            "pageText": "“In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply”; and this one: “His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that and very soon were sleeping” (italics added). One may argue that such passages serve to punctuate Melville’s sexual and matrimonial metaphors, semantically marking them in such a way as to heighten (but not confuse) readers’ awareness of the measure of their deviance from social norms. One might even go so far as to argue that Melville instinctively and unconsciously mobilizes some measure of reader anxiety about crossing racial and sexual boundary lines the better to call readers’ attention to what he has to say about the importance of human attachments in general.\nMelville emphasizes this importance throughout the novel by generating numerous images of attachment, especially images of hands grasping and ropes connecting, thereby valorizing the relationship of Ishmael and Queequeg (and Pip and Ahab) in the process. In addition to the umbilical coil of Madame Leviathan, positive images of attachment are notable in the following instances. In one chapter Melville tells us of the “monkey-rope” that connects Ishmael (aboard ship) to Queequeg (on the whale’s carcass): “So that for better or worse, we two, for the time, were wedded. . . . An elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.” In the emotionally tonic chapter called “A Squeeze of the Hand,” where sailors process chunks of fat in tubs of previously boiled whale blubber by squeezing them, Ishmael says that “I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gende globules.’’ “Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget” that Ishmael is moved to declare, “Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come: let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.”\nThe images of grasping hands and connecting ropes merge in the memorable dialogue between Pip and Ahab. Pip cries, “Ding, dong, ",
