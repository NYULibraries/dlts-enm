Still, I believe that the development of masculine emotional capacities, self-expression, and cooperation are part and parcel of the progression of power relations, that is, they serve as a modest beginning, a location of some promise, a glimpse into the possibility that young men can operate for social progression.\nSkateboarding's Appeal and the Construction of Adolescent Masculinities\nAs Fred Pfeil noted in 1995, feminist scholars frequently think of masculinity as monolithic without taking into account the variations in power afforded by class, race, sexuality, and so on.9 Critical race and queer theory have begun to explicate masculinity via its intersections with other axes of identity, and a mere glance at the title of R.W. Connell's oft-cited Masculinities, published in the same year as Pfeil's White Guys, reveals that at least some scholarly work on male identity has taken into account its multiplicity.10 In his extension and critique of scholarly discussions of the 1990s white male backlash, Sean Brayton argues, rightly, that “rather than conceiv[ing] of masculinity as some homogenous category of manliness, it is more useful to recognize a series of masculinities.”11 Still, scholars continue to struggle with analyzing male identity. What to do with such multiplicity? How to pin it down? How does one make a claim about male identity when it seems to be constantly shifting? One strategy is to examine how masculinity is negotiated by men—how they justify and respond to their particular expressions of masculinity—and then align these expressions with men's particular expressions of or encounters with power. That is, rather than assuming that masculinity equals power—or even that straight, white, American, middle-class masculinity equals power—we should first explicate how that masculinity is expressed and how, in turn, it does or does not manifest itself as various demonstrations of power.\nIn discussions of their identity as skateboarders and their devotion to skateboarding culture, skaters reveal that masculinity poses a problem for them. In reverent descriptions of the experience of skateboarding, the adolescent boys I interviewed disclosed a yearning for the opportunity to express themselves and a space in which to feel a sense of freedom or transcendence.\n",
