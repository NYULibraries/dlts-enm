            "pageText": "Capturing the epistemology and the revolutionary fervor of the time, the inimitable Paine wrote, “But such is the irresistible nature of truth, that all it asks, and all it wants, is the liberty of appearing. The sun needs no inscription to distinguish him from darkness.” 123 In similar terms, “Massachusettensis” expressed a certainty that thousands would feel the truth of what he had written and felt that even “those who obstinately shut their eyes against it now, haply the fever of the times may intermit, there may be some lucid interval, when their minds shall be open to the truth, before it is too late to serve them; otherwise it will be revealed to them in bitter moments, attended with keen remorse and unutterable anguish.”124\nMost revealing was the use of the metaphor to define the moral quality of opponents. “Do we claim any but what are as clear as the noon day?” queries a writer in The Constitutional Courant. Earlier in the pamphlet, the writer uses a variant of the same metaphor to describe the coercive nature of truth: “The arguments by which these points have been established beyond all dispute, I need not repeat; their evidence is such as must flash conviction into the minds of all but the vile minions of tyranny and arbitrary power. The tremendous conclusion, therefore, forces itself upon us, that the public faith of the nation, in which, till now, we thought we might securely confide, is violated.”125 The writer makes it quite clear that failure to see the truth is attributable to a defect of character, not to any want of the truth. Disagreement with the Whig program becomes prima facie evidence of corruption. There is no possibility of honest difference of opinion, only ulterior motives.\nIf all parties, both Whigs and Tories, felt the truth to be both real and inexorable, if the philosophy of omniscience was as prevalent as here claimed, where is the source of debate, why the need for advocates? In the first place, it appears that they did build their case on values and belief held by the audience rather than being in opposition to or outside the audience’s frame of reference. In the second place, it now appears that if the Whig rhetors are to be considered prophets, so must Tory rhetors, for they seemed to hold the same basic truths and with the same conviction.\nGranting a common epistemology, an agreement on method, we can yet conceive different conclusions. There is room for a significant distinction to be made between Whig leaders, their Tory counterparts, and the people at large, and that distinction lies in the radical’s basic orientation to the status quo. Tories like Daniel Leonard did not deny natural law, but found in its dictates a “duty to remain subject to the authority of parliament.”126 ",
