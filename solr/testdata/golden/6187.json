            "pageText": "\nreferences to Meredith's newfound maturity position the tale as a novel of development or bildung, but at the conclusion, she has nothing to replace the purpose and meaning that anarchism gave to her life. Instead, she is stuck at her new stage of maturity. She is no longer an anarchist, but still lacks a place in mainstream public life.\nThe novel depicts this dilemma as a specifically bodily one, indicating that Meredith's female body is the root of the problem, for it is not the dynamiters or free-love advocates who drive Meredith outside the movement through extremism, but the purity advocates. Toward the novel's end, Meredith becomes fixated on what she considers the folly of hygienic strains in revolutionary politics, such as the temperance movement and vegetarianism. Her frustration with those who deny their bodies emerges just as she suffers from sexual rejection; Meredith's virulent reaction against ascetic strains of anarchism thus appears to be displaced anger regarding her own inability to reconcile body and politics. The object of her desire is Ivan Kosinski, a Russian anarchist famous for “his absolute unswerving devotion to his ideas” (26). Kosinski is known to hate women, making consummation of their relationship seem unlikely: “From the first moment Kosinski interested me. His manners were not engaging; towards women especially he was decidedly hostile…. perhaps his evident aversion to my sex … had for me a certain fascination. I felt attracted towards the man” (29–30). Kosinski's misogyny stems from suspicion about women's political commitment: “Women are rarely of much use in a movement like ours. They so rarely seem able to forget themselves, to detach themselves from the narrow interests of their own lives. They are still the slaves of their past, of their passions, and of all manner of prejudices” (233). Meredith's inability to square her political beliefs and bodily desires is, to Kosinski, a specifically female failing, but his analysis neglects to account for the fact that it is precisely women's bodies that impede their full political participation.\nHence, at the end of the novel, Meredith is stuck between a radical asceticism that cannot satisfy her body, and a mainstream society that cannot occupy her mind. After suppressing her feelings for Kosinski for much of the narrative, she finally speaks: “We Anarchists are always talking of the rights of the individual, why are you deliberately sacrificing your personal happiness, and mine? … I love you, and I know that you love me” (267–68). Kosinski's response exercises a privilege that is revealed in the novel to be specifically male—the privilege of denying the body: “An Anarchist's life is not his own. Friendship, comradeship may be helpful, but family ties are fatal” (268). The novel ends with no resolution\n",
