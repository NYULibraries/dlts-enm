We need to give them room to create, even as we teach them to think like historians.16 What follows is one example of how I have approached the challenges posed by students' views of how the past can, or should, be used, analyzed, and presented. The course described below evolved from several years of thinking about how best to address both the pervasive problem of students' lack of skepticism about sources—online or analog—and their interest in creating content for the Internet, rather than merely consuming it and regurgitating what they consumed in a five-, seven-, or ten-page paper. I also wanted my students to have some fun while they were confronting real historical issues. The results of this teaching experiment have not been without controversy. More than a few historians and librarians (and even someone posting on my blog under the name Jimmy Wales—the founder of Wikipedia) were not amused. I have been called “pond scum,” “sociopathic,” and even received one death threat after a writer for the Atlantic.com wrote a story about the second iteration of the course.17 Others found the exercise thought provoking and worthy of deeper consideration. Wikipedia editors had an energetic debate about what to do about the way my students decided to use Wikipedia in their projects—a debate that offers some very interesting insights into the thinking processes and community standards of the world's largest encyclopedia.18 The point I would like to make with this example is not that it should be emulated in the specific, but rather, in the general sense, by which I mean it demonstrates the power of meeting students where they live in the digital world. If they make history using digital media, they are much more likely to understand history, and to embrace it as more than just a subject they are interested in. They will become historians themselves, some of them in ways we have not yet thought of.\nLying About the Past and the Last American Pirate\nI have already described one rewrite of the historical methods course—Dead in Virginia—in which my students wrote extensively in a class database. An earlier rewrite of the methods course was called Lying About the Past. In this version of the course, I jettisoned all emphasis on historiography in favor of a focus on creating historical content in digital media in an attempt to teach a course focused on making and creating content, rather than learning about the works of the great historians. Also, because I had already seen evidence of students (and the public at large) taking a more ",
