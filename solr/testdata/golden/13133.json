Rev. 409 (1994) (hereafter, VanBurkleo).\n44. Ibid., at 411.\n45. Ibid., at 414.\n46. Ibid.\n47. Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1776-1860 (1977). For an appraisal of Horwitz’s book, see, e.g., Stephen Presser, Revising the Conservative Tradition: Towards a New American Legal History, 52 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 700 (1977).\n48.

I still suspect it was, at least among the Supreme Court justices. See, e.g., Casto’s recent discussion of James Wilson’s views on American common law and constitutional law, and how they were both grounded in divine natural law. Casto, at 131-132, 194-195.\n53. VanBurkleo, at 413.\n54. Letter from Richard Peters to Timothy Pickering (Jan. 24, 1804), 10 Peters Papers, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 91.\n55. VanBurkleo, at 413.\n56. See, e.g., Casto, at 92, suggesting that charges about Chief Justice Rutledge’s alleged insanity were political cover for attacking him based on his opposition to the Jay Treaty. See also seditious libel trial defendant Representative Matthew Lyon’s publication of the suggestion that when the House and Senate heard John Adams quote Edmund Burke on the perfidy of the French, “We wondered that the answer of both Houses had not been an order to send him to a mad house.” Stephen Presser and Jamil Zainaldin, Cases and Materials on Law and Jurisprudence in American History 201-202 (3d ed. 1995) (hereafter, Presser and Zainaldin, Cases and Materials).\n57. VanBurkleo, at 413. Compare the more admiring view of Chase’s commitment to liberty in Judson, and Stormy Patriot.\n58. One of the best statements of this point of view is to be found in Samuel Chase’s manuscript jury charge book, discussed in Original Misunderstanding, at 141-149.\n59. There is an increasing sensitivity among historians for approaching the late eighteenth century on its own terms, without being blinded by our preconceptions. Especially valuable here is Casto.",
