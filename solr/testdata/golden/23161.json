            "pageText": "Much has been made of the consensual nature of presidential power. Presidents bargain, they persuade, but they rarely command (Neustadt 1990).15 There are, however, several major drawbacks to this focus, one of which is that it neglects the president’s important role of educating the public on his view of its needs. Public education is not merely a “textbook” virtue for a president. It has direct and practical consequences on his ability to lead. This is especially true for the Clinton administration, given the basic public dilemma that frames his presidency.\nEducation is part of how the public comes to understand its predicaments. It is how they begin to understand what can (and cannot) be done about public problems and the consequences of different actions (and inaction). Establishing credibility in these areas is central to establishing trust between the president and the public, a crucial element in presidential leadership and effective performance.\nAll presidents must sell their policies to some degree. But there are important differences between selling and educating. One striking characteristic of the Clinton presidency is the extensive role of political consultants, which is without precedent. “Previous Presidents had pollsters and other outside political advisors, but never before had a group of political consultants played such an integral part in a Presidency” (Drew 1994, 124).\nThe president’s economic stimulus package, his health-care proposals (Kelly 1993d), and even the inauguration (Berke 1993b) were carefully scripted public events designed and carried through for political purposes. This strategy has worked in some cases. But can it be successful as an overall approach to policy, given Clinton’s promise to reinvent government and the lingering problems of trust with which he began his presidency?\nThe Tasks of Presidential Leadership\nPresidential leadership involves three distinct tasks: mobilization, orchestration, and consolidation. Although they are related, each requires different skills of a president. A skilled president will be adept at all three or know enough to authorize others to carry them out. Most effective presidents have strong skills in at least one of the first two areas; it is very rare for a president to be an effective leader otherwise.\nThe first task, mobilization, refers to the president’s ability to rouse the public. To do so, he must clearly identify a problem in need of solution and convey that need to the public. In arousing the public, education is ultimately ",
