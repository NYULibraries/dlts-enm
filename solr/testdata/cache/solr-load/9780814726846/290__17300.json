The New Testament states:\n[T]he Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.\n1 Thessalonians 2:14–16; see Nicholls, supra note 3, at 84, 126–27.\n13. See Nicholls, supra note 3, at 3 (the image of the Jew as Christ killer is a central element in Christian myth and is taught to all Christians).\n14. See Pagels, supra note 3, at 10, 103.\n15. Matthew 27:25 (emphasis omitted).\n16. John 19:12–16. The official Latin title of Pilate as governor of the Roman province of Judea was praefectus, combining “prefect” (emphasizing military command) with “procurator” (emphasizing financial responsibility). Ferguson, supra note 5, at 42.\n17. John 19:4–7. Likewise, the Gospel of John adds: “Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.” John 5:18. And in a similar vein:\nI [Jesus] and my Father are one. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.\nJohn 10:30–33 (emphasis omitted).\n18. John Dominic Crossan calls the passion narratives “prophecy historicized,” not “history remembered.” Crossan, supra note 3, at 1–8; see Pagels, supra note 3, at 3–111. But cf. Raymond E. Brown, The Death of the Messiah (1994) (arguing that the passion narratives represent historical fact). The passion narratives are the New Testament passages referring to the trial and death of Jesus. See Nicholls, supra note 3, at 21.\n19. See Fricke, supra note 3, at 117–20 (many bands of insurgents); Silver, supra note 2, at 97 (many messianic movements). From 66 to 73 C.E., the Jews fought a war to free themselves from Roman rule. Rome defeated the Jews and destroyed the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 C.E. See Epstein, supra note 1, at 108–12; Johnson, supra note 1, at 127, 136–40.\n20. See Nicholls, supra note 3, at 86–89; Telushkin, supra note 2, at 545–47. Rabbi Telushkin emphasizes that many Jews long have been skeptical about the coming of a Messiah. He reports that a first-century sage, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, said: “If you should happen to be holding a sapling in your hand when they tell you that the Messiah has arrived, first plant the sapling and then go out and greet the Messiah.” Telushkin, supra note 2, at 545.\n21. Crossan, supra note 3, at 212. See Fricke, supra note 3, at 117–20; Johnson, supra note 1, at 141; Silver, supra note 2, at 97.\n22. See Jaher, supra note 3, at 34–35; Nicholls, supra note 3, at 105–07; Pagels, supra note 3, at 14 (during the first century c.e., the Romans arrested and crucified thousands of Jews).\n23. See Fricke, supra note 3, at 4, 109, 127–32.\n24. During this period, there were at least four major groups within the Jewish community—the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Zealots, and the Essenes—but many Jews did not officially belong to any of these groups. When Rome defeated the Jews and destroyed the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the vitality of the Sadducees was undermined because they focused largely on Temple worship. In fact, the Pharisees were the only group to substantially survive the war. See Epstein, supra note 1, at 95–109; Johnson, supra note 1, at 127, 136–40; Monk \u0026 Stamey, supra note 5, at 6–7, 9; Ruether, supra note 3, at 45, 60, 75, 77.\n25. See Epstein, supra note 1, at 95–107; Fricke, supra note 3, at 4; Johnson, supra note 3, at 100, 106, 108, 121–22, 127; Ruether, supra note 3, at 58–59, 67–69, 86–88; Wistrich, supra note 3, at 13–14. William Nicholls tersely summarizes the historical record: “The Jews did not conspire to kill [Jesus] and were not responsible for his death. He met his end on a Roman cross condemned by a ",
