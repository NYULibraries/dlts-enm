            "pageText": "Court recognized that coercion existed in this particular context, although the students were allowed to remain silent or to leave the room when their classmates recited the prayer. The Court used language that buoyed the hopes of advocates of a strong separation of church and state:\n\nWhen the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain. But the purposes underlying the Establishment Clause go much further than that. Its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion.59\n\nCourt observers either hoped or feared—depending on their perspective—that Engel was a watershed decision. To many, Engel demonstrated the fulfillment of the dominant story of church and state: surely, the argument went, the religion clauses protected the religious freedom and equality of outgroups if even nondenominational prayers could not be recited in public school classrooms.60 Consequently, as then described in The New Republic, Engel provoked “the most savage controversy” since 1954, when the Court held in Brown v. Board of Education that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional.61 For the most part, Engel unleashed a torrent of ridicule on the Court, which, according to many, “had betrayed the American way of life.”62 For example, a Wall Street Journal editorial lamented the likely implications of the decision: “Poor kids, if they can’t even sing Christmas carols.”63 Unsurprisingly, Engel led to yet another spurt of proposals to add a Christian amendment to the Constitution; indeed, the 1964 platform of the Republican Party called for such an amendment. And in a particularly insidious argument, some Christians ominously observed that such judicial decisions might soon spark a wave of antisemitism. These Christians suggested, in other words, that Jews (litigating before the Court) caused antisemitism: Jews could generate a renewal of overt antisemitism if they (and other non-Christians) did not allow Christian Americans to retain those practices that stamped this nation as Christian.64\nThe Supreme Court cases decided in 1963, the year after Engel, supported the notion that Engel had been a landmark. The first case, Abington School District v. Schempp, also involved prayer in the public schools. A state statute required that, at the outset of each day, every public school was to read to its students ten verses from the Bible, recite the Lord’s Prayer, and then recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
