Romaine Brooks: The Case of a Great Painter of the Human Face1\nRomaine Brooks, for want of tolerable friends, has not had the enemies she deserves.\nOne of them, believing that he described her unkindly, made this remark which seems to be a most heartening description: “She is a foreigner everywhere.”\nAnd, in fact, Romaine Brooks belongs to no time, to no country, to no milieu, to no school, to no tradition; nor is she in revolt against these institutions, but, rather, like Walt Whitman, neither for them nor against them—she does not know what they are. She is the epitome, the “flowery summit” of a civilization in decline, whose character she was able to capture. Almost a subconscious psychologist, she puts on her canvases the best kept secrets of the distinctive personalities she paints. She operates on them, relieves them of existence, through a confession so strong and so delicate that they themselves are won over to it. Her radiant personality, with an apparent naïveté, reassures falsely. Under this good-natured appearance, she makes contact with the beings whom she permits to pass before her, the better to renounce them.\nNot just anyone is painted by Romaine Brooks!\n",
