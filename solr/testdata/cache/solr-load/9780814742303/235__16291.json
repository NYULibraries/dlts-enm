            "pageText": "2 and 6 of this agreement. The Office will, however, inform the sentencing court of the nature and extent of SALVATORE GRAVANO’S conduct and activities with respect to this case and all other information in its possession relevant to sentencing.\n5. The Office agrees that, except as provided in paragraphs 1, 2 and 6, no criminal charges will be brought against SALVATORE GRAVANO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for his heretofore disclosed participation in criminal activity. This agreement, however, covers only those criminal acts that have been disclosed to the Office as of the date of this agreement.\n6. SALVATORE GRAVANO must at all times give complete, truthful and accurate information and testimony, and must not commit, or attempt to commit, any further crimes whatsoever. Should it be judged by the Office that SALVATORE GRAVANO has intentionally given false, misleading, or incomplete information or testimony, or has committed or attempted to commit any further crimes, or has otherwise violated any provision of this agreement, SALVATORE GRAVANO shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Office has knowledge, including, but not limited to, perjury and obstruction of justice.\n7. If the Office determines that SALVATORE GRAVANO has cooperated fully, provided substantial assistance to law enforcement, and otherwise complied with the terms of this agreement, the Office will file a motion with the sentencing court, setting forth the nature and extent of his cooperation with the Office, including its investigative and prosecutive value, truthfulness, completeness and accuracy. Such a motion will permit the court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence below the applicable sentencing guidelines range. In this connection, it is understood that the Office’s determination of whether SALVATORE GRAVANO has provided complete cooperation and substantial assistance, and the Office’s assessment of the value, truthfulness, completeness, and accuracy of the cooperation, shall be binding upon him. The Office cannot and does not make a promise or representation as to what sentence will be imposed upon the aforementioned plea of guilty.\n8. This agreement is subject to the approval of the Court. The rule provides that such approval may be given at the time SALVATORE GRAVANO enters his plea of guilty, and the Office agrees to recommend that the Court approve the agreement at that time.\n9. If SALVATORE GRAVANO requests, the Office will make application and recommend that he and, if appropriate, other individuals be placed in the Witness Security Program operated by the United States Marshal Service.\n10. This agreement is limited to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, and it cannot bind other federal, state, or local prosecuting authorities. It is further understood that this plea agreement does not prohibit the United States, any agency thereof, or any third party from initiating or prosecuting any civil proceedings directly or indirectly involving SALVATORE GRAVANO, including, but not limited to, proceedings by the Internal Revenue Service relating to potential civil tax liability.\n",
