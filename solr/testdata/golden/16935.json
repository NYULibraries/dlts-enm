Just as the defender of the market need not object in principle to restricting the sale of nitroglycerin or automatic rifles, so he need not object to restrictions on the sale of children.\nA further point about this subject is more fundamental, if it is not actually another way of saying the same thing: namely, that the defender of the market may also take the line that children cannot be owned. Certainly the marketer thinks that adult humans are not ownable: slavery is fundamentally objectionable, in his view. Since slavery is a relation of domination in the literal and uncontroversial sense of that term in which it involves the exercise of force over one person by another, it is ruled out. At what point children become rational agents who therefore have the rights of agents on the market instead of commodities on it is no doubt difficult to decide in any satisfactory manner. Some, though not I, would hold that children simply are by nature not commodities. But even if we reject this latter, in my judgment obscurantist position, the considerations adduced in the foregoing paragraphs may have the same effect. It may be that we do best simply to declare that children are not to be for sale, and that is that.\nThis doesn’t leave Radin answered entirely satisfactorily, I agree. But I hope at least to have shown that the specter of “universal commodification” is not one we need fear in market society.\n6. RADIN ON “INCOMPLETE” COMMODIFICATION\nLet us turn in conclusion, to Radin’s theses concerning incomplete commodification. The suggestion is that we develop a theory of justice alternative to that in which there are, on the one hand, agents with their inviolable personal rights and, on the other, things owned or ownable by them that are available for exchange. In this alternative theory, “who should get what things of value depends upon the appropriate relationship between persons and things, and between persons and other people.”25 But that is not a helpful statement, since every theory of justice is statable in such a form.
