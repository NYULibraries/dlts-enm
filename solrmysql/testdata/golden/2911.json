            "pageText": "icking a scene from the stoney comedy film Super Troopers). That stunt landed him happily on YouTube. Another corollary if unintended result was Craig’s post-mama-Butterworth’s sugar-induced, trembling, hyperactive bad trip. This venture into worldwide digital culture did not establish Craig’s stardom nationally, as it has for others who have parlayed YouTube “lonely girl” videos or self-created bizarre ethnic characters into larger television and movie roles. Instead, he merely secured his local status as a wild and crazy guy, an achievement in itself.\nCraig’s stunt is not high art, but I’d lay claim to its attempt to make art with a small “a,” humor in the crude mode of Jackass, where Steve-o wears a diaper packed with crawfish or drunks box while tilting akilter on stilts. The urge of both video ventures is less to outrage their audiences than to be outrageous as a way to be seen.\nConsider the everywherenicity of the camera. It’s now part of every street corner, supposedly keeping us safe. It’s the agent of our alleged defense against terrorist plots in airports as well as bus and train terminals. It’s how parents film (and thus remember) a son’s first goal or a daughter’s horseback-riding blue ribbon. It’s both the source of keepsake photos we scrapbook away and the means of carrying those photos with us at all times on our laptop or cell phone galleries. It is our way of recording the chimera of daily existence, impossibly various and overwhelming in its velocity. And the video camera is the first technology able to keep up with that frantic pace, to play back for us what happened to happen while we were looking elsewhere, thinking elsewhere, being elsewhere. Who now resolves, as my mother once urged me, to “take a picture with your mind” to remember a distinctive scene? Why, Mom, when my camera phone’s in hand?\nWhile the desire to validate one’s existence may not be new, the means— as well as the compulsion—to do so via digitized media quite assuredly is. As Narcissus was once seduced by his watery reflection, have we not become enamored of our own video likeness? The second generation of psychoanalytic theory known as object relations theory (Donald Woods Winnicott, Heinz Kohut, Harry Guntrip, et al.) focused on the developing self’s desire to have self-worth “mirrored back” to us by a loving parental object. Over time, we seek out other objects to do the same—one’s god or art or a loving spouse—but the yearning is the same: to have one’s sense of being valued and safe underwrite our ability to venture out into a frightening world. This primary narcissism is a core ingredient of one’s mental health.\n",
