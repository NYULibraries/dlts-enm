Survey collectors with NSDF identified eighty-four such settlements (referred to as chawls, nagars, wadis, or colonies) by asking residents where they lived (National Slum Dwellers Federation 1986). The survey also found that while most residents lived in family units, many individuals had come to work and send money back to their home villages. While some of these labor migrants rented first-floor rooms in the chawls, many lived in pongal houses, or dormitory buildings housing between thirty and one hundred men. The survey enumerated sixty-two pongal houses in Dharavi (Sharma 2000). This finding underscored the problems of determining program eligibility on the basis of documentation of tenure, given that the most disadvantaged of Dharavi’s residents would be the first ones evicted.\n      The SPARC-NSDF survey also revealed that despite the PMGP’s emphasis on housing improvement, Dharavi was as much an industrial and commercial enclave as a residential one. The survey enumerated 43 large industrial units and 244 small-scale ones, engaged in such activities as leather work, printing, video editing, packaged-food making, recycling, scrap dealing, and garment manufacturing (National Slum Dwellers Federation 1986). These findings contradicted widely held perceptions about slums, not only on the part of the general public, but also by the PMGP planners. Despite the Correa Committee’s somewhat innovative recommendation that Dharavi be redeveloped on a large scale—as an integrated township—program administrators continued to treat Dharavi as a housing problem and to direct the majority of PMGP resources toward housing construction and improvement.\n      State Capacity and Diminished Expectations\n      Despite the Correa Committee’s recognition that political fragmentations and administrative weaknesses had undermined earlier attempts to address Bombay’s worsening slum problem, as well as their recommendation that a new agency be created to administer the program (Sharma 2000; Mukhija 2003), most assessments of the PMGP have concluded that the program’s rather limited success was a product of political fragmentation and administrative weakness (Pinto 2000). Urban planning scholar Vinit Mukhija (2001a, 798), for example, asserts that the state’s institutional capacities were stretched too thin when a single agency was given the responsibility for implementing such a complex program. Mukhija elaborates that the state’s decision to administer the program wholly at the ",
