            "pageText": "in my argument for compensation asserts it to be—then perhaps redistributive transfers to underwrite that “minimal baseline norm of human existence” are themselves morally mandated by the selfsame principle. It may be confusing to call it “compensation.” But the confusion is minor, since redistribution of that sort serves the same moral goal as compensation itself.\nExactly where the “minimal baseline norms” should be set for what goods should probably be left open. In general, this “preconditions of agency” style of argument implies that those norms should guarantee everyone enough of what they need to be able to plan their lives at all. What that amounts to is an empirical matter. It seems empirically likely, however, that the gravest forms of deprivation remedied by the redistributive transfers of the welfare state—gross poverty, protracted unemployment, persistent illness, and homelessness—would all qualify as major interferences with any planning at all. They therefore qualify for relief under my principle.60\nThe “preconditions of agency” argument is most persuasive when the resources involved are, literally, preconditions. That is to say, the move is most persuasive when it is literally impossible to frame and follow any lifeplans at all unless those resource needs have been met. But that is a limiting case that will rarely occur. The handicaps for which programs to aid the disabled compensate (impaired mobility and the like) reduce one’s options. But they hardly preclude one from conceptualizing plans, nor do they usually even reduce one’s options down to a single possibility. The same is arguably true of poverty and most of its corollaries.61\nIf “preconditions” is too strong, “preoccupations” may serve almost as well. The reason we should redistribute resources to meet people’s basic needs is that without those resources the psychological prerequisites of planning one’s life are lacking. Almost inevitably, people who do not know where their next meal will come from or where they will sleep, tonight will find those concerns completely absorbing.62 Preoccupied with how to satisfy their immediate needs, they are incapable of thinking much beyond that. If we regard it as desirable for people to frame and follow plans of a larger sort for their lives, we ought ",
