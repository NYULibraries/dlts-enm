            "pageText": " analogical relation to the visible body, online self-invention effectively places everyone in the position previously reserved for certain raced subjects: everyone must mime his or her identity” (145). Yet the power-free zone that Hansen envisions within the virtual encounter is certainly called into question by the call center exchange as the terms of the performance of identity are deeply embedded within postcolonial power relations.\n17. Mohanty (2003) finds that experience becomes the problematic foundation for universal sisterhood. She argues, rather, that “historicizing and locating political agency is a necessary alternative to formulations of the ‘universality’ of gendered oppression and struggles” (107). Moya (2002) argues that experience is “the fact of personally observing, encountering, or undergoing a particular event or situation,” noting that experience should be theorized “in its mediated form [which] contains an epistemic component through which we can gain access to knowledge of the world” (38). Scott (1998) is critical of the ways that experience is deployed to shore up nondiscursive notions of subject formation. Rather, Scott argues, “It is not individuals who have experience, but subjects who are constituted through experience” (60). Although Scott’s poststructuralist orientation certainly departs epistemologically from Mohanty and particularly Moya’s realist orientation, all of these notions of experience presume a simultaneity of experience and knowledge formation. Here we wish to consider what happens to the category of experience when knowledge and lived reality become decoupled.\n18. Affective labor, Hardt and Negri (2004) argue, “is labor that produces or manipulates affects… . One can recognize affective labor, for example, in the work of legal assistants, flight attendants, and fast food workers (service with a smile). One indication of the rising importance of affective labor, at least in the dominant countries, is the tendency for employers to highlight education, attitude, character, and ‘prosocial’ behavior as the primary skills employees need. A worker with a good attitude and social skills is another way of saying a worker adept at affective labor” (108). When we factor in the extent to which call center workers must reconfigure their relationships to time, space, culture, the performance of identity, and local affective encounters, the cost of affective labor is contextualized beyond the immediacy of the encounter in which positive affects are produced. This is to suggest the importance of contextualizing affective labor within broader sociocultural and historical sites of its production, and in this case disparate consumption. \n3. “I INTERACT WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD”\n1. Many contemporary political, feminist, and globalization scholars have begun to theorize the range of contestations constitutive of contemporary citizenship in ways that depart from previous concepts of national citizenship. With the emergence of universal human rights and economic globalization, such shifts usher in new forms of subjectivity beyond, within, and outside of nation-states (Mouffe 1992). New sites of belonging, often imagined as postnational and oriented around sexuality, diasporic",
