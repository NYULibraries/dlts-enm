The messiah does not have any special duties before the redemption; after its achievement by the nation as a whole, he becomes its crowned leader.45\nThat Luria and his disciples never demanded any special role for themselves or their beliefs in the affairs of the community, and did not suggest any institutional or devotional changes besides stricter adherence to accepted norms, made them a conservative and unthreatening power within the history of seventeenth-century Jewish communities, and facilitated the rapid spread of this doctrine and its acceptance by Jewish communities all over the world.\nAmong all the elements of Lurianic mysticism, none was more potent and profound than the image of exile as the plight of the divine powers themselves. When a Jew experienced the hardships of exile he could now remember that God had been in exile long before him; even more, that God’s redemption was dependent upon the actions of every individual Jew. Exile was a cosmic phenomenon after the “breaking of the vessels,” and redemption involved the restoration of the divine powers to their rightful place. By placing the Jewish experience of exile in the heart of the divine world itself, Lurianic theology acquired power and impact unseen before in the history of Jewish thought.\nFor the first time in the history of the Jews in the diaspora, Judaism as a whole was united in the belief in one theology, one set of symbols, and one basic terminology. The few who did not accept the mythology presented by Luria still acquiesced to the current spirit of their world and expressed their admiration to Luria as a unique personality, as presented ",
