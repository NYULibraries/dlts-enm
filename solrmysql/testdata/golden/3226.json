            "pageText": "\nTrtl\nIn 2003 and 2004, abandoned buildings, bridges and road signs in and around downtown Detroit began to be tagged with graffiti featuring cartoon turtles and the words “trtl,” “trdl,” “turdl,” “turtl,” or “turtdlz.” After turtles appeared on a sculpture outside of the Detroit Artists' Market and on the Detroit Institute of Art's regal building, turtle-tagging became the object of police attention, public critique and media speculation alike.\nMost generally, turtles were understood to signify “slowness.” Their status as subject matter for graffiti in Detroit was thus posed as a comment on the slowness with which Detroit was being reconstructed, as if the graffiti were calling for the eradication of the derelict surfaces on which they were themselves inscribed. More precisely, however, the enigmatic action of turtle-tagging converted the city's surfaces into mirrors that reflected the the city's own collective sense of itself. The “slowness” ascribed to the turtle-tagger, outed by the Detroit Free Press in 2004 as the graffiti artist, Ronald Scherz, was actually a product of the artist's audience. This audience saw an image they themselves projected onto turtles—the image of a city historically constructed on the basis of mobility and speed but one currently defined by torpor and inacitivity.\n",
