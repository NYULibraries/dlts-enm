            "pageText": "NOTES\n1. Thomas E. Hill Jr., “Four Conceptions of Conscience,” this volume, 14.\n2. Ibid., 15–16.\n3. To avoid confusion, let me emphasize that I am not arguing that there are no differences among the accounts at all; rather, I am arguing only against the specific distinction that Hill makes. It is possible, for example, that the Kantian conception of the conscience succeeds in building a stronger case for deferring to conscientious beliefs insofar as it, alone, insists on the necessity of double- (and triple-, indeed endless re-) checking one’s moral judgments. The process of continual reconsideration, prescribed by the Kantian account (as Hill describes), can be seen as minimizing the risk of moral error and thus resting its claim for the authority of conscience on that risk minimization, rather than on some unattainable ideal of moral “objectivity.” The fact that none of the various accounts can claim “objectivity” does not imply that they are equally good at minimizing the risks of moral error. My gratitude to Professor Jody Armour for helping me see this point.\n4. Hill, “Four Conceptions of Conscience,” 20.\n5. Ibid., 20–21.\n6. Ibid., 29.\n7. Ibid., 35–36, 37.\n8. Ibid., 21–22.\n9. Ibid., 26.\n10. Ibid., 23.\n11. Ibid., 23.\n12. Ibid., 24.\n13. Ibid., 20.\n14. Although I do not have the evidence to prove this essentially empirical point, I find it unlikely that Himmler experienced the rationalizations in his head as the promptings of his conscience. It seems far more likely that he—or at least others who participated in the Nazis’ crimes—had internalized certain cultural norms that created some sense of moral discomfort regarding those crimes but that they let other (non-conscientious) desires overcome those pangs of conscience. It is also conceivable that some Nazis were socialized in a way that lacked the distinctively moral concerns that properly merit the label of conscience. The possibility that the Nazis felt the impulse to exterminate Jews and others as the voice of the conscience is only one possibility among others.\n",
