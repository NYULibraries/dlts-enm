Once an individual unconsciously internalizes a tacitly transmitted cultural stereotype, she unconsciously interprets experiences to be consistent with the underlying stereotype, selectively assimilating facts that validate the stereotype while disregarding those that do not. As a result, she views her negative attitudes toward Blacks as rational reflections of the observable world, rather than as culturally determined and constructed entities.
