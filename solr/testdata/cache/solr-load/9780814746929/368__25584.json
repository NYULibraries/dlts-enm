            "pageText": "the mainstream of our thinking. Yet it is basic, as modern depth-psychology has demonstrated. The social implications of the progressive awareness of ever larger wholes in society are obvious.\nThus, God as the field-building pole of being is approached through the highways of reason, aesthetics, and ethics. We think of Him as the Self of the Universe, related to our self, in its field-building capacity, as our self is related to the material world. Yet these ways of cognizing are only formal, belonging more to philosophy than to religion. Basic as these avenues are, they constitute only the substructure of religion. For it is in attachment to God and His will that religion is born, and once this attachment is discovered, a new level of aspirations and feelings is opened up for the human personality.\nIt is in prayer that religion is born. In the beginning is the selfâ€™s immediate reverence before the Master of the universe, its abasement before the Majesty of its source. It is not the believer in God who prays, but it is the worshipper who believes. The polarity of being has its correspondence and reflection in the life of the soul, which moves rhythmically from aggressive self-assertion in the world of reality to passive self-surrender to the Maker of this world.\n\n\n",
