            "pageText": "The next spring when we formed our official team for the sixth-grade Softball competition, I was picked to play third base. I wasn’t very good as a third baseman; second base was really my position. But Jean Thompson was picked to play second base, and Jean Thompson turned out to be one of our best players, which was kind of a big deal, because Jean was a girl.\nI guess the moral to the story is that it is wrong to assume that just because a kid is skinny or wears glasses or doesn’t know the rules of soccer, he can’t play baseball. Also, I guess, that no kid will ever seem to be much of a ballplayer if he—or she—never gets the chance to play.\nThe Myth of the Market\nIn America we have forsworn assumptions about people’s talents or aptitudes based on their race, gender, or apparent disability. Everyone is presumed to possess equal ability; each individual is afforded the same benefit of the doubt.\nIn America we have abolished attempts to exclude people from social, political, or economic life based on their race, gender, or apparent disability. Everyone is afforded an equal opportunity; each individual rises or falls on her merits.\nThere are occasional transgressions: a few individuals apparently haven’t gotten the word. They still make assumptions, they still exclude. We punish these acts of malicious discrimination; we seek their elimination. They are all that stand in the way of true equality.\nThis is our vision of equality: equality as equal opportunity. This is the root of inequality: malicious denials of equal opportunity. This is the myth of the market, the “official” myth of merit.\nReconstructing the Market: Guaranteeing Equal Opportunity\nWill equal opportunity produce a genuine equality? The question was in the forefront of much of the debate surrounding the Reconstruction effort. Some argued that it would, that the complete liberation of black Americans would permit them to assume an equal position—legally, politically, socially—with white Americans. They opposed liberation for that reason.\n",
