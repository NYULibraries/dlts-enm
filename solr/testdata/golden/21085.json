            "pageText": "understanding of violence and the role that it plays in his life is extremely limited. When Michael eventually renounces violence his only comment on this decisive action is, simply, “Okay.”\nJust as the film fails to present any reasons for U.S. involvement in Vietnam, so too it evades the need to understand the war itself. The old woman’s question of the priest is repeated as the group of friends approach a returned Green Beret soldier at the wedding reception for Steve (John Savage) and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Michael’s questions “Well, what’s it like over there? Can you tell us anything?” are met with a terse “Fuck it!” The response points to “the major ideological problem of the film, Cimino can no more show Vietnam than the Green Beret can speak it.”43 Indeed the in-country segment of the film depicts the Vietnamese people, north and south alike, as devilishly Other, and the war as an inexplicable moral vacuum swallowing young Americans of good intentions.\nOne of the few references to the nature of the war, besides the implication that the South Vietnamese were not worthy allies, comes in the form of the metaphor of Russian roulette. The crucial scene in which despicably cruel North Vietnamese soldiers force American prisoners to “play” the game replicates, as H. Bruce Franklin points out, the “infamous historical sequence in which General Nguyen Ngoc Loan placed a revolver to the right temple of an NLF prisoner and killed him with a single shot.”44 The Deer Hunter manipulates this image to “reverse the roles of victim and victimizer.”45 The spurious nature of the metaphor is reinforced through the fact that the “game” is known as Russian roulette, an allusion that implicates broad geopolitical blocs within the Vietnam War in terms consistent with popular Cold War interpretations. As a comment on the war in Vietnam, the metaphor is lamentably inaccurate. The inadequacies of The Deer Hunter are further illustrated through reference to Cimino’s failure to invest his characters with any opportunity to speak. In the initial roulette scene and in the subsequent scenes of the game being played in Saigon, speaking, other than the hysterical shouts of those betting on the outcomes, is absent. As a result of the violence Nick (Christopher Walken) experiences at the hands of his captors, he is excused from further attempts at speech by retreating into virtual catatonia.\nReleased the same year as The Deer Hunter, the film Coming Home explicitly addresses itself to giving the veteran a voice—in fact the film opens with physically disabled veterans speaking of their attempts to come to terms with their situation. Issues that The Deer Hunter failed to raise concerning the meaning of the war are here referred to in the course of the ",
