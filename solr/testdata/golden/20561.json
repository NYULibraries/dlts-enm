Some of the alienation may result from a misperception that there is a feminist orthodoxy—that feminists must be career women or pro-choice or antipornography. Another thread of alienation may include the factionalism implied by some pop culture figures, which may surface simply as feminist-bashing, or as a tendency on the part of some feminist writers to reduce honest intellectual disagreements to the personal level.\nSome of the early theorists, such as Shulamith Firestone, who described motherhood and procreation as sources of oppression, offended many traditional homemakers by speaking of the roles in which some women had invested themselves as forms of enslavement. In her 1970 classic, The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution, Firestone wrote that “[t]he first demand for any alternative system must be. . . . The freeing of women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology by every means available.” She proposed the technological neutralization of the social impact of sex differences through test-tube reproduction and communal child rearing. While Firestone and others were making critical theoretical points about institutions, the high theory was lost or perhaps mistranslated, and the idea devolved in the popular mind into an attack on motherhood.73 Some traditional homemakers perceived that the feminist movement, in championing abortion rights, was indifferent to their concerns about quality child care. In the “dismissive shorthand” of the 1980s, “feminism came to mean denigrating motherhood, pursuing selfish goals and wearing a suit.”74\nWhile critics have counterpoised feminism and motherhood, many prominent feminist theorists have long argued that feminism must address concerns of mothers and children. In 1981 Betty Friedan, in The Second Stage, strenuously advocated the inclusion of men’s and children’s concerns in the feminist agenda. The “second stage” that Friedan envisioned was an integration of work and home, feminism and family.\nParticular issues have disunited feminists, few as seriously as abortion. One feminist commentator has asserted an inherent antipathy between the pro-life position and feminism, stating, “pro-life feminism, as currently formulated, is a contradiction in terms.”75 Others, such as Kathleen McDonnell in Not an Easy Choice: A Feminist Re-examines Abortion, find more room in the feminist movement for a difference of opinion.
