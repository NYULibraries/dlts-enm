Its contours varied in accord with one’s philosophic approach. Accordingly, we may best describe the concept by filling in the details in the several self-images as they appear at the rationalistic pole of thought and at the mystical pole. It will then be possible to indicate the degree to which one or another concept predominated in the minds of the legalistic authorities, who steered generally a middle course between the two extremes.\nAlready in the Talmud and Midrashim the mystical character of Israel is suggested. “The image of Jacob is carved into the throne of Glory,”16 we are assured, and, when the patriarch enjoyed his famous dream, the angels went up and down on the heavenly ladder, comparing the upper image with the lower one.17 The Throne of Glory symbolizes the aspects of Divine power that relate to the administration of mundane affairs. We are told that this Throne of Glory “hovered over the deep” before the creation of the cosmos.18 The soul’s of the righteous are kept there after death until the Messianic redemption, the resurrection, and the World to Come.19 Another passage tells us that “the Patriarchs—they are the Divine Chariot”20—that is, they are part of the mediating channel of Divine grace. Abraham, in particular, had a continuing function in heaven. His prayers and those of the other patriarchs keep the scales of mercy weighted against those of justice.21 Also, he stands at the gates of hell in order to prevent those who are circumcised from being thrown into its yawning abyss.22\nThe close mystical association between Israel and the Divine Being is adumbrated in the concept of the Shechinah, the Divine Presence. In one sense, the Shechinah is found where love, compassion, and devotion abide.23 In yet another sense, “ten person’s who steadily engage in the study of Torah, the Shechinah rests with them . . . even five . . . even three . . . even one . . .” 24 In a more potent, more openly manifest way, the Shechinah was found in certain synagogues in Babylonia.25 But in a special and more immediate sense, it dwelt in the Holy Temple, and it ",
