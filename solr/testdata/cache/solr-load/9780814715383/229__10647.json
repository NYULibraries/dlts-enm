            "pageText": "this framework would expand the scope of Harris’s recovery. The derogatory comments to Teresa Harris about her intelligence, because accompanied by overt sexualized comments, would easily constitute sex-based harassment.\nA problem with the New Jersey standard is that it does not discuss how courts should apply the “unwelcomeness” standard to cases of mixed sexual and nonsexual gender-based conduct. Courts need to clarify that the “unwelcomeness” inquiry is only relevant to sexual conduct. As applied to Harris’s situation, for example, comments about her purported stupidity should have been considered per se unwelcome; Harris should have had a successful claim based on those comments before her discussion with Hardy about the unwelcomeness of the sexualized comments. Moreover, under the New Jersey guidelines, those comments about her stupidity could be used to infer that the sexual comments were intended to harm her at the time they were uttered; they were not reflective of “joking” behavior. In other words, an individual who is making entirely unacceptable comments about stupidity that must have been intended to cause harm could be understood to be making contemporaneous comments about sexuality that also must have been intended to cause harm. There is no policy reason to tolerate any derogatory and gender-based comments about one’s intelligence. Sex harassment doctrine should clarify this policy.\nNot addressed by the proposed EEOC guidelines or the New Jersey Supreme Court rule is how to address claims brought by individuals who are perceived to be gay men or lesbians. These individuals have not been able to take advantage of the longstanding sexualized harassment doctrine. We should retain the principle that sexualized comments are prohibited by Title VII but extend that protection to individuals who are perceived as being gay and lesbian.\n",
