// Tricky...this assumes that location of the templates relative to working directory
// matches what the location would be if calling `go run main.go` from root of this
// repo.  This is brittle, breaking in multiple cases:
//
// * Doing `go run [PATH TO main.go` or calling the binary from somewhere relative
//   to the templates directory other than what's assumed below.
// * `go test` on tests in a directory that would set working directory to some
//   place other than what's assumed below.
//
// Consider including the templates in the binary using something like
