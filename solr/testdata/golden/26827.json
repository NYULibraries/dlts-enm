Many of the children came to school without breakfast, and the staff could not always provide hot lunches. Steven watched the children trying to learn, reaching out for a better life. He cherished running the music program, integrating traditional African music into the curriculum and making jazz accessible to young minds.\nSince the Malcolm X School could not put Steven on salary, he looked elsewhere for employment. Having been trained as a draftsman, he went to many job interviews at architectural firms. But there seemed to be no place for a black draftsman. After a number of failed attempts he sought out the help of the Bay Area Urban League. The League’s veterans’ affairs coordinator thought highly of Steven and was able to obtain a position for him.

Steven took them to the Blackman’s Free Clinic, where they were examined and given antibiotics. But neither of them got better. Steven worried that they might have tuberculosis like his uncle, and he took them back to the clinic. This time the doctor recommended they see a specialist. But they had no money for a specialist. Elaine asked Steven if she could apply for welfare. His response was angry and bitter. “No wife of mine will ever take the white man’s handout,” he shouted. “I can take care of my family; I’m the man of the house.” They had discussed and argued about accepting welfare before; each time Steven’s pride was wounded and he would retreat into a shell of silence. This time the frustration of days of knocking on doors for jobs that were not ",
