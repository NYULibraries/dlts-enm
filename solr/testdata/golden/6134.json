His ineffectiveness as a “voice” against capitalism is implied by his dampened speech: he has “a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest” (73). Karl Yundt, another anticapitalist rhetorician, is similarly ineffectual. Though he self-identifies as a “terrorist,” he is ironically afflicted with gout, the disease of wealthy decadence (74). Like an aristocrat, he enjoys a leisured existence: “The famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice” (78). The Professor, an associate of the group who makes bombs, is likewise weak and sickly. He serves as the novel's mouthpiece for Nietzschean individualism, but is apparently no Übermensch: “The lamentable inferiority of the whole physique was made ludicrous by the supremely self-confident bearing of the individual” (88).\nMeanwhile, the novel's titular secret agent, Adolph Verloc, shows no penchant for agency: he has “an air of having wallowed, fully dressed, all day on an unmade bed” (46), and holds a “philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort” (52). The narrator refers to Verloc as “burly in a fat-pig style” (52), and here, as in Heart of Darkness, Conrad uses obesity to signify a repudiation of the militaristic restraint with which he had lived during his years at sea. Conrad typically depicts such discipline and efficiency as the hallmark of masculine productivity; thus the narrator's denunciation of the anarchists' obese and lethargic bodies illustrates the distinctively physiological way that the novel conceptualizes and represents male dissipation. In both novels, the failings of the men are identified as failings in their bodily productivity and physiology.17\nThis focus on the degenerate male body extends to the novels' depiction of male sexuality: the men cannot produce, nor can they reproduce. Throughout The Princess, Hyacinth's desultory attempts at sexual intimacy prevent him from cementing his masculinity through heterosexual conquest. He pursues two women from vastly different backgrounds, but in the end, both reject him for another man. Hyacinth explicitly links his sexual unproductiveness to what he sees as a biological defect—his criminal inheritance: “He would never marry at all—to that his mind was absolutely made up; he would never hand on to another … the inheritance which had darkened the whole threshold of his manhood” (105). His only “bedroom scene” involving a woman occurs at the novel's conclusion, when the Princess finds him in bed, dead, with a\n",
