            "pageText": "to Walesa’s ascendance to the Presidency, which cost him his following among the intelligentsia and the masses, is the downfall of the union.\nSuch popular cabaret suggests significant progress toward freeing the national form from the national cage. As for the author of Trans-Atlantic, the point is not to cease being Polish but to allow for an alteration in the terms by which that identity is conceived. As Gombrowicz wrote:\nSome of my compatriots regard me as an exceptionally Polish author — and I may well be both very anti-Polish and very Polish — or perhaps Polish because anti-Polish; because the Pole comes to life in me spontaneously, freely, to the extent in which he becomes stronger then I….\nI wouldn’t be at all surprised if the black humor of Trans-Atlantic were an almost involuntary expression of Polish pride and liberty.42\nThe major tradition in Polish nationalism views itself as the nationalism of an oppressed nation, without a political state but with a strong aspiration for one. As such, this tradition developed a space for women in the ranks of the warriors for the national cause. In the heroic phase of the national movement, women, as well as other minorities (such as assimilated Jews) were welcomed into the ranks of the nation and the role of women was not limited to producing warriors but instead included a part in the fight. With the transformation from aspiring and defensive nationalism to the celebration of independence, the structural position of minorities and women changed dramatically. It is this phase of nationalism — with unrestricted freedom and among a cacophony of contending voices — that the patriarchal hierarchy once again is attempting to dominate the stage and to direct the staging of the national drama.\nThe “political coinmunity” is now being defined in a rigid and exclusive manner by the pragmatic nationalists of the Christian National Democratic tradition, mobilizing and manipulating images from all the “patriotic” traditions of Poland’s past as long as they do not contradict the necessity to keep women in their rightful place. Against this model a new political community is beginning to imagine itself in opposition to the stifling air around the national icons. In this antinationalistic insurgency, women are both well represented and crucial to its construction. Just as Gombrowicz saw himself as a Moses leading the human (male) Pole out of the confines of Mickiewicz’s male patriotic ethos, getting the Pole out of the Pole, so it is the female-centered satire of Olga Lipinska’s theatre that is aiming to liberate a sexual Polish woman out of her familial self, the Polish Mother, into which the same poet had cast her.\n",
