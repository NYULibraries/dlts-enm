            "pageText": "she knows how to raise her children right. So she raised me right and I guess she said through prayer and asking God and just taking a lot of time, asking me questions, and being straightforward with me, I got to be the man I am.\nSo you attribute a lot of it to her?\nAll of it, just about.\nChallenging the belief, held inside and outside of his own community, that single women cannot properly raise male children, Jamal attributes his success almost exclusively to his mother. In light of the previous discussion of girls’ ability to speak honestly in their relationships, it is noteworthy that Jamal identifies his mother’s “straightforward[ness]” as the very reason for her success in raising him, and as the reason he is the man he is today. After speaking about his friends and girlfriend, Jamal says that out of all of his relationships, his relationship with his mother is the most important: “Yeah, I never put anyone in front of my mother. No way.”\nWhen Jamie, Jamal’s junior-year interviewer, asks Jamal about his relationship with his mother, he says: “We’re real close, we’re good friends, we talk about things. … If I’m not sure of anything I’ll just ask my mother and she’ll just give me advice. Not real real personal personal things though.” Jamal’s close feelings toward his mother do not include sharing his most personal experiences but rather a mutual commitment and a willingness to solve problems together. This type of closeness was more common among the boys than among the girls. For the girls, being close to their mothers typically involved telling her “everything” or “most things.” For the boys, the bases of their close relationships had more to do with respect and admiration than with open communication.\nLater in his junior-year interview, Jamal identifies his mother as the person he most looks up to:\nI want to get a little bit more of a sense of understanding of how and why she’s been so important to you.\nYou know—you know one-parent family. The only person around is my mother so I have no father. So every time I need something I go to my mother. So if I need something done, I gotta go to my mother. If I need her help, I go to my mother. She’s been there for so long.\n",
