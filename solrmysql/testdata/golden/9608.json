            "pageText": "being so strong and competent in his absence. In my letters I went on about my accomplishments. I renovated our house, I bought a new car, I graduated from the university, and I had a nice savings account that he would be able to use when he returned. Obviously it pleased him to have such a wife and family back home. On the other hand, it wasn’t easy for him. I remember that after his return, Golda Meir’s secretary called for some reason and mentioned to Menachem how wonderful I had been during his absence. He reacted by saying, “Why is everybody telling me how wonderful she was? What about me?” I realized that my accomplishments were hard for him to take. He saw me as the young girl he had rescued from a miserable childhood. I have always let him feel like the boss of our family, because I liked it that way. But all of a sudden life had turned me into my own boss, and I had managed well, almost effortlessly.\nI had, for example, a savings account. I opened it in his name and gave it to him when he returned, telling him that he would not need any of the loans offered to returning POWs. He wasn’t happy about it at all. He took the whole amount and bought equipment for our new kitchen, and that was it—as if telling me: “Take this fancy kitchen I organized for you, just so you know who is the boss around here.” The truth is I didn’t have any intention of taking his authority from him. I have always been willing to allow him all the initiative and authority he was willing to take; I dislike being in such a position anyway.\nWhat has remained with me from the time of Menachem’s captivity is the fear for my family. I am happiest when we are all together. When someone is missing, I feel anxious. I think that if I ever had to cope again with a similar situation, or with any significant crisis in one of our lives, I would not be able to stand it. What remained with Menachem is the need to stand out, to excel. He had it before, but it became more intense. All I want in life is to be a normal wife and mother, in a normal family. For Menachem it has never been enough, but we have learned to live with our differences.\n",
