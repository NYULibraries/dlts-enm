            "pageText": "Finally, Chopin presents Edna with Flaubertian mockery as a woman who is given to romantic fantasies about unattainable men. Before she reaches puberty Edna becomes “passionately enamored of a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visit[s] her father” (ch. 7). She cannot “remove her eyes from his face, which [is] something like Napoleon’s, with a lock of black hair falling across the forehead.” The cavalry officer melts “imperceptibly out of her existence,” but in her early teens “her affections [are] deeply engaged” by the fiancé of a lady on a neighboring plantation. The realization that she herself is “nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged young man [is] a bitter affliction” to Edna, but he, too, goes “the way of dreams.” Evidently her passions were not as deep as she had imagined them to be. As a grown young woman, she is “overtaken by what she suppose[s] to be the climax of her fate,” as “the face and figure of a great tragedian [begin] to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. The persistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. The hopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.” The tone here is similar to that of Madame Bovary.\nCourted by Léonce while she is “in the midst of her secret great passion,” Edna decides to accept him when she realizes that “the acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian, was not for her in this world” (ch. 7). It is not long before the tragedian goes the way of “the cavalry officer and the engaged young man and a few others.” When she marries, Edna feels that she has closed “the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams” and has entered the world of reality. She takes satisfaction in the fact that “no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious warmth” colors her affection for her husband, “thereby threatening its dissolution.”\nChopin presents Edna’s attraction to Robert Lebrun not only as a sexual awakening but also as a return to the realm of romance and dreams, which was not forever closed to her after all. When Robert leaves for Mexico, Edna recognizes in her despondency “the symptoms of infatuation” she had experienced a number of times before, but, like Emma Bovary, she cannot view herself with critical detachment:\nThe recognition did not lessen the reality, the poignancy of the revelation [of her love for Robert] by any suggestion or promise of instability. The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to heed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate. The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that ",
