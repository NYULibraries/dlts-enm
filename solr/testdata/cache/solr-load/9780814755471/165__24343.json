There is no simple separation between ethos and content. If one is to teach a student to be a better writer or speaker, this entails improving the quality of their reasoning, the quality of their evidence, the decency of their emotions, as well as their ability to use commas and vocal pauses. At least if one follows the classical criteria for rhetoric and composition, criteria that extend back to Aristotle, a teacher is enjoined to improve the ethos (character), pathos (emotions), and logos (logic) exhibited in a student’s speaking (and writing).2\nThere is, however, a terrible cost to this set of practices, and that cost increases with every increment of difference between the teacher and the student. Students do not want to be told that they are illinformed, narrow-minded, incapable of consistent thought, selfish, and cruel. They do not want to be compared (even in the most cloaked fashion) to mewling infants who care only for their own warm bottle, and look not beyond the next feeding. They most certainly do not want to be given that as a reason for why they are not going to get an A for the speech they wrote at 2 a.m. last night. Given that many students are relatively empowered to fight back in many institutions, I conclude that professors who feel powerful are powerful only because their goals and views are consonant with their students’ and institutions’. The rest of us face a very different set of circumstances, and theories of teaching that do not recognize the different personae who make up teaching and learning situations are of little use to us.\nTheories of Teaching\nAlthough I have used personal examples to suggest that the variability of the ethos of students and teachers makes the application of theories to teaching practice treacherous, I would like to deepen that claim by illustrating these pitfalls with regard to three contemporary ",
