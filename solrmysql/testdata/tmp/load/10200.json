            "pageText": "group behavior, so by the time they reach elementary school, the time devoted to controlled activities is much longer than the time spent in free, unritualized play, although some periods of (alarmingly) free play remain available to children all through elementary school.\nNot infrequently, especially at the beginning of their school life, individual children show that they “do not understand” group activities and rituals. Teachers extravagantly praise those who do cooperate, and they wait patiently for the others to comply, not scolding, but explaining over and over that it is necessary to be part of the group. Otherwise, the next set of activities, playing or going home, for instance, simply cannot take place. The teacher waits for other children to tell the laggards to participate and then seconds their calls, often more politely. Other students bring pressure to bear on those who are reluctant, because they do not want to be constrained any longer than necessary in these formal situations. Peak reports incidents in which the frustration of waiting for reluctant classmates leads to “letting off steam” behaviors such as loud, inarticulate screaming, carried out by the whole group. Teachers interpret this as evidence that unanimous group action is intrinsically rewarding to children, evidence that they can be led to appropriate unanimous behavior “naturally.” Though it may take a while, all eventually conform, and it is either because their peers persuade them or because they all want to move on to other things, not because teachers eventually resort to force to resolve an issue. Children are persuaded to cooperation and participation, not forced into it. (I must say that the relentless efforts at persuasion sometimes seem to me more underhanded and nastier than an outright imposition of power and authority. I also think this is a very American reaction on my part.) A lot of time is spent in this way, especially at the beginning of school, but it is not time wasted; it is the curriculum of preschool.\nPreschools also start the practice of rotating leadership roles among the members of the class. Each child is routinely, not as a reward or a punishment, given a turn to be the leader. Children seem to like this, ",
