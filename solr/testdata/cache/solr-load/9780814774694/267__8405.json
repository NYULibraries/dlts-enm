            "pageText": "nationally and particularly low for Clinton’s draft district (Hot Springs). Second, and more important, President Nixon announced on October 1, 1969, that even students who were called up could finish their year in graduate school.\nClinton was again reclassified 1-A, on October 30, 1969, while in his second year of a two-year program at Oxford. The draft lottery was established on November 26, 1969. In the first lottery drawing on December 1, 1969, Clinton received a high draft number, ensuring that he would not be called in the draft. On December 2, he submitted his application to Yale Law School. His letter withdrawing from his ROTC promise and thanking Colonel Holmes for “saving him from the draft” is dated December 3, 1969.\nIn the letter to Holmes, Clinton recalls that he wrote a letter dated September 12, 1969, to the chairman of his local draft board, soon after he and Holmes met (during the summer), asking to be let out of his promise to join the ROTC and to be reclassified 1-A. Clinton wrote to Holmes that he never mailed that letter,\nbut I did carry it on me every day until I got on the plane to return to England. I didn’t mail the letter because I didn’t see, in the end, how my going into the army and maybe going to Vietnam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved. (Clinton 1992, A25)\nIn response to the February 6 Wall Street Journal article (before the February 12 release of his 1969 letter to Colonel Holmes), Clinton recalled having informed Holmes of his decision to withdraw from his ROTC promise in September or early October (Kelly 1992c, A1). Yet it is somewhat unclear, given the December 1969 letter in which Clinton relates writing but not mailing a letter of withdrawal and his conviction that being drafted would serve no purpose, why he would have done this so shortly after having concluded that there was no purpose to be served in doing so.\nThe phrasing of Clinton’s response to the February 6 Wall Street Journal article implies that he informed his draft board personally in October 1969 of his decision. However, in an interview with Ted Koppel on Nightline (ABC transcript, 12 February 1992, 9), Clinton said that he had asked his stepfather, who had since died, to pass on to Colonel Holmes Clinton’s intention to stand for the draft in late September or October. Again, it is unclear why he would do so, after having written a letter withdrawing from his commitment but not having mailed it, since he had come to the conclusion that his induction would serve no purpose.\n",
