            "pageText": "and to combat them philosophically. Here he has, to his satisfaction, restored to Jewish thought the basis for believing in God’s existence and his providence, by showing that a teleological vision of nature, which necessitates a supervising deity, is a philosophical necessity. To claim otherwise would be to render the existence of complex, organized beings totally incomprehensible. Thus, enlightened Jews should have no difficulty affirming the existence of God, and attributing personality to him, at least as a being possessing a will independent of intellect, and thus compelled by no necessity.\nThe Nature of God\nBeginning with the Deists in seventeenth-century England and on to the Enlightenment, the Jewish concept of God came under frequent attack; this God was perceived as wrathful, vengeful and narcissistic. He was the commanding presence who “ruled” over his charges by instilling fear in them; on the basis of this fear, Jews went about engaging in many ridiculous ceremonies that they assumed were desired by God, in the hope of avoiding his wrath and placating him. In the mature work of Hegel we begin to find a far more philosophically sophisticated treatment of religion in general and Judaism, in particular, which, however, continued to portray Jewish theology in a negative light. As it is the works of Hegel and, to a lesser extent, Schelling, that provide the challenges to which Krochmal responds, we must first look at their own work on theology and metaphysics, and then outline Krochmal’s response.\n",
