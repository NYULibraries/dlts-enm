            "pageText": "\nfounded by Jerry Yang and David Filo, was Yahoo. Yahoo's core value contribution, like that of several of its competitors, was to structure the Web into discrete categories, serving not as a creator of content but as a directory pointing users to others' content. The recognition that the Web was, first and foremost, a platform on which to share documents and even conversations goes back to its invention by Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), built a generalized platform to share and discuss documents. Yahoo and its peer companies extended a part of this vision by creating a framework around which these documents could be organized on a global scale. Soon, the company extended this aggregation notion into news and ultimately became the world's largest Web news service, without creating any content.\nYahoo built this early position in news by understanding the essential character of the Web—that its value was as much in the aggregation and sharing of links as in the distribution of content. The explosion of choice and personalization, now harnessed by Yahoo and others, overwhelmed many mainstream news organizations. This soon led to the emergence of a new kind of Internet company—the portal—that offered a broad range of services under a single brand umbrella.\nThe Dawn of Web 2.0\nWeb 2.0 has become a buzzword without much meaning, but the folks who coined the term—Tim O'Reilly, John Battelle, and others—saw something fundamentally different emerging from the ashes of the dotcom bust. O'Reilly, in particular, has taken pains to create a substantive definition of the idea. His diagram in figure 2 depicts its many components.\nIn his post “What Is Web 2.0?” O'Reilly writes, “Google is most certainly the standard bearer for Web 2.0.”2 But as figure 2 shows, there are many broad aspects to the concept that have gotten lost, as Web 2.0 has been simplified in the popular press as the mere description of the post-bust era or reduced to the concept of “social networking.” From the perspective of the hyperlinked society, the most interesting aspect of O'Reilly's diagram is the user positioning, the idea that users now control their own data. This has many implications and relates to the hyperlinked news organization in profound ways. Notions of user participation, online identity, reputation, and the “granular addressability of content” have all begun to change users' expectations of what a news service should\n",
