As Forbes reported, “Extreme sports are coooool. Edgy, adrenaline-inducing pursuits.”220 In fact, The X Games was so cool that NBC launched its own version, The Gravity Games, in 1999. Still, Forbes claimed, “These guys are no Michael Jordans,” for the athletes' involvement in extreme sports was not resulting in huge incomes.221 Sport suggested that, while extreme sports “emphasize freedom and self-expression and are fueled by equal parts talent and adrenaline,” their stars, such as Tony Hawk, were “overexposed.”222\nMarketers were indeed wary of attempts to co-opt this subculture. Forbes warned of the fate of Nike's 1995 attempt to break into the skate shoe market. Although the company waged an award-winning marketing campaign depicting golfers, runners, and tennis players being chased by police and asking, “What if we treated all athletes the way we treat skateboarders?” a boycott led by the skateboard manufacturer Consolidated Skateboards rendered the shoe unsuccessful. Tony Hawk told Forbes, “Nike has a tainted image, because people consider it cashing in on skateboarding's success.” Still, Forbes reported, many marketers had been successful in their appropriation of skateboarding, and Hawk advised, “You have to make sure that whatever you're doing is hard core.”223 He later told the New York Times that he had rejected a proposal to market pasta shaped like him,224 and his manager and sister, Patricia Hawk, refuses to sell the Tony Hawk clothing line anywhere but in department stores.225 In a later article, Forbes explained the limits some extreme athletes were putting on their endorsements, including refusing sponsorships by alcohol and tobacco companies and “reject[ing] brands that depict their sport as a sideshow.”226 Business Week discussed shoe company Vans' strategy for maintaining its authenticity, noting that it focused its efforts on “events, sponsorships, and even a documentary film [Dogtown and Z-Boys] to celebrate the outlaw nature of skateboarding culture.” Vans' efforts were apparently successful, for in 2001 its sales were up 23 percent from the previous year.227 As Rinehart explains, ESPN maintained The X Games' aura of authenticity by anticipating charges of co-optation and preempting them with clever rationalizations.228\n",
