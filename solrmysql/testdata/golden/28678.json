One of the images, which caused much anxiety among many native-born U.S. citizens, was the figure of the poor, overly fertile Latina immigrant, who—due to her large number of children—had become trapped in a culture of poverty, crime, and violence. This negative image undoubtedly informed readers’ interpretation of “Out of the Shadows” and helped them classify the information they received about the Reyes family.\nThis portrayal of Latina mothers also needs to be read in the context of debates about “welfare mothers,” which occurred almost simultaneously and helped to construct a negative image of women on welfare and poor women in general. According to the welfare reform discourse, “the stereotypical welfare mother is a symbol of the supposed irresponsible, sexually promiscuous, and immoral behavior of the poor” (McCormack 2005, 660). Not surprisingly, the larger neoliberal framework suggested that these women had fallen on hard times because of the poor choices they had made—choices about their education, employment, partners, and having children out of wedlock. Single motherhood emerged as one of the major explanations for poverty. “Welfare mothers” were supposedly poor and “dependent” on welfare because they were sexually promiscuous. Their irresponsible behavior was seen as a threat to not just their own economic survival but traditional family values and domestic stability. This image was far from race neutral: “Embedded in the notion of the welfare mother are powerful ideologies of race, class, and gender that . . . portray women, particularly Black and Hispanic women, as inadequate mothers; and view nontraditional family forms as pathological” (McCormack 2005, 660). Political debates and media representations in the mid-1990s were able to build on this negative image of “welfare mothers” and develop a similar racialized and hypersexual portrayal of poor Latina immigrant women.\nIn the study, Marcelina Reyes, in particular, emerged as a problematic figure. Married to an abusive husband who made less than fifteen thousand dollars per year, Marcelina had seven children in quick succession. Hence she had no opportunity to learn English, get an education, or take advantage of job training opportunities like Mari Ortiz or Maria Hernandez. It was not even necessary for the authors to connect these pieces of information. The larger discourse only allowed for one possible explanation: Marcelina’s seeming unwillingness to control her fertility had ",
