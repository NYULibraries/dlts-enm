A flower garden and a courtyard—seemingly out of place in a part of the city where nearly every bit of space is used to either house someone, make something, or sell something—give way to a freshly painted two-story bungalow with a brick-shingled roof. The door to the house, an almost three-inch-thick piece of intricately carved teak, is the building’s most striking feature and its most conspicuous display of the owner’s wealth. On the other side of the door, the home’s interior is equally striking, but more for its sparseness than for any of its particular features or furnishings. One rarely finds this much open space in Dharavi.\n\t  \n        \n        Iconic image of Dharavi’s seemingly endless expanse of aluminum rooftops.\nPhotograph by Benji Holzman.\n      \n      ",
