The narrator decides that Liuba, “the beggar rusalka,” is a symbol of all of Russia.\nThe second symbol is an old woman with nondescript features, “the kind you see many of and therefore don’t notice.” What makes this particular old woman so striking is the “enormous pig’s head” she holds against her chest, close to her own head. The pig’s head gives the old woman “individuality.” The narrator is “amazed” at the correspondence between the physical features and expression of the old woman and the pig. It strikes him that the old woman is the perfect image for Liuba’s mother-in-law, the “criminal-victim.” Furthermore the old woman with the pig’s head is a “second hypostasis of Russia, who tramples on and consumes everything around her … and in the first place, herself” (50). The narrator concludes that the traditional image of the Russian maiden meeting the “black limousines” of the government officials with bread and salt should be replaced by his two hypostases of the old woman, “Mother-in-Law Russia” carrying an aspic made of her own head, and Liuba, bringing her bread crusts and “damp gray salt.”\nThe grotesque old woman is at once perpetrator and victim, a Mother Russia, or, as Gorenshtein mockingly puts it, “Mother-in-Law Russia,” who feeds not Father Tsar or Father Stalin, but Father Apparatchik with her own flesh. The contrasts between Gorenshtein’s “Mother-in-Law Russia” and Rasputin’s Dar’ia are striking. Gorenshtein’s old woman destroys her home by goading her daughter-in-law to murder; Dar’ia is the conservator of hearth and home. Dar’ia is very nearly fleshless and belongs more to the spirit world of her ancestors than to the here and now. Gorenshtein’s Mother-in-Law is emphatically corporeal; her alter ego, the pig’s head, has features that “swim in fat.” In her self-destroying and self-rejuvenating fleshiness, Gorenshtein’s Mother-in-Law carnivalizes the saintly spirituality of the old women of village prose.\nThe final irony of Gorenshtein’s “Last Summer on the Volga” is turned against the narrator himself. The rusalka-beggar Liuba turns out not to be what he first thought. When at the end of the story the narrator unfolds the piece of paper on which “Liuba” has written her address, he finds only the name written over and over, with pictures of the sun, moon, clouds, and crosses. “Liuba” had been playing a part, the part she knew was expected of her: the criminal victim with the heart of gold.
