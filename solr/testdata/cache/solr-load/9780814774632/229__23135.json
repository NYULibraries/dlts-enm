At a meeting called to discuss health care,\nSome of those who attended found her intimidating—hard to argue with and uninterested in the points they made. Mrs. Clinton’s style was very direct. She told people straight out what she thought. She’d say, “You’re right,” “You’re wrong,” “That’s the way to proceed,” “No, that’s not right.” … Mrs. Clinton displayed a certain impatience. And her humor was biting. (Drew 1994, 194–95)\nSome have seen in these traits a tendency to assign people credit or importance based on their capacity to further what she sees as the right thing to do. When troubles began to mount for the nomination of the Clintons’ good friend Lani Guinier, Guinier writes,\nIt languished without either emotional or logistical support from my friends in the White House. I saw Hillary Rodham Clinton in the West Wing. … She breezed by me with a causal “Hi, Kiddo.” When someone tried to tell her that we were in the White House to strategize on my nomination, she turned slightly and said, “Oh” … and, to no one in particular, announced, “I’m thirty minutes late for lunch.” [Since that time] I have not had any communication with the President or First Lady, although I did get two identical, machine signed White House Christmas cards in December.

Coupled with her own sense of virtue—which, like her husband’s, is the foundation of her idealized self-image—this has led to the tendency to experience herself as besieged by enemies. She doubtless has many enemies because of her political efforts, but her own psychology and perceptions play an important role as well.13 She “has long been inclined toward bunker mentality. She tolerates critics much less graciously than her husband. … She defines morality on the legacy of the issues of her youth … and assigns partisan evil to most detraction” (Brummett 1994, 244).
