See Eissler, “Scapegoats of Society,” in Searchlights on Delinquency, 299–304.\n2. Ruth Eissler suggests that society, needing criminals as scapegoats, ensures the criminals’ existence in two ways: (1) by seducing individuals into lives of crime, and (2) by interfering with measures to prevent delinquency. See ibid., 295.\nFrom the discipline of sociology rather than psychoanalysis, Kai Erikson has also raised the question whether society is organized in such a way as to encourage deviant behavior, including criminality. See Kai Erikson, “On the Sociology of Deviance,” in Crime, Law, and Society, ed. Abraham Goldstein and Joseph Goldstein (New York: Free Press, 1971), 94. Erikson’s work builds on that of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who observed, as early as 1895, that crime was really “an integral part of all healthy societies.” Emile Durkheim, The Rules of Sociological Method (1895; reprint, Glencoe, ILL: Free Press, 1958). Quoted in Kai Erikson, “On the Sociology of Deviance,” 87. In his classic work The Division of Labor in Society, Durkheim had already proposed that crime performs an important function by uniting people in a common stance of righteous indignation, thereby strengthening the group’s bond of solidarity. See Emile Durkheim, The Division of Labor in Society (1893; reprint, New York: Free Press, 1933), 108–9.\n3. Cf. Erikson, “On the Sociology of Deviance,” 94 (‘[T]he agencies built by society for preventing deviance are often so poorly equipped for the task that we might well ask why this is regarded as their’real’function in the first place”). For the suggestion that prisons actually generate crime, see Johannes Andenaes, Punishment and Deterrence (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1974), 179; Peter Low, John Jeffries and Richard Bonnie, Criminal Law, 2d ed. (Mineola, N.Y.: Foundation Press, 1986), 27 (“[M]uch of the recent criminological literature” includes claims that “prisons breed crime”); Robert Blecker, “Haven or Hell? Inside Lorton Central Prison: Experiences of Punishment Justified,” Stanford Law Review 42 (1990): 1194–95 (quoting prisoners who assert that doing time makes a person more dangerous upon release).\nNOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO PART THREE\n1.
