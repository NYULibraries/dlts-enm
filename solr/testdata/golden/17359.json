See Amendments to the Constitution of 1776, reprinted in 2 Poore, supra note 1, at 1415, 1418 (allowing all Christians to hold office); Constitution of North Carolina (1868), reprinted in 2 Poore, supra note 1, at 1419, 1430 (this Constitution still barred “all persons who shall deny the being of Almighty God”); Borden, supra note 1, at 42–50. Borden notes that Jacob Henry, who was Jewish, served in the state legislature in 1808 without any objections. When he was reelected, however, another delegate protested that Henry “denies the divine authority of the New Testament.” Borden, supra note 1, at 43. Ultimately, the legislature allowed Henry to retain his seat, reasoning that the constitutional provision barred non-Protestants from holding offices within a “civil department” of the state and that the legislature was not technically a civil department. Id. at 44.\n51. Constitution of Connecticut (1818), reprinted in 1 Poore, supra note 1, at 258, 264; see Borden, supra note 1, at 28. In 1843, the Connecticut state legislature passed a special enactment providing “that Jews who may desire to unite and form religious societies, shall have the same rights, power and privileges which are given to Christians.” Borden, supra note 1, at 29.\n52. Constitution of New Hampshire (1792), reprinted in 2 Poore, supra note 1, at 1298–1301, 1308–09 (the amendments were framed by a convention in 1876 and ratified by the people on Mar. 13, 1877); see Borden, supra note 1, at 33–34; Levy, supra note 1, at 40. New Hampshire was the last state to eliminate its religious test or restriction on public officeholding. See Borden, supra note 1, at 32. Frederic Cople Jaher writes: “Between the 1780s and 1830s these restraints [on public officeholding] were eliminated except in New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, and were absent from the fundamental charters of newly admitted states. From 1789 to 1792, for example, Delaware, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia . . . enfranchised Jews.” Jaher, supra note 1, at 121.\n53. Constitution of New Hampshire (1792), reprinted in 2 Poore, supra note 1, at 1294; see Borden, supra note 1, at 35–36.\n54. Correspondence Between the Jews of Charleston, S.C. and the Governor of South Carolina, and other documents (Nov. 1844), reprinted in Schappes, supra note 1, at 235, 236–37, 240–42.\n55. Information on the so-called Jew bill of Maryland can be found in 1 Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 33–55; Borden, supra note, at 36–42; Cohen, supra note 1, at 40–42.\n56. Constitution of Maryland (1776), reprinted in 1 Poore, supra note 1, at 817, 820.\n57. See Report of the Select Committee (1818), reprinted in 1 Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 37.\n58. Cohen, supra note 1, at 41.\n59. Election Handbill (1823), reprinted in 1 Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 48, 49.\n60. See 1 Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 48; Jaher, supra note 1, at 132. Jaher notes that the bill probably passed more for economic reasons than for a principled commitment to religious liberty. See Jaher, supra note 1, at 132–33.\n61. Final Form of the “Jew Bill” (1826), reprinted in Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 53, 53. This bill was incorporated in the Maryland Constitution of 1851. See Constitution of Maryland (1851), reprinted in 1 Poore, supra note 1, at 837, 839.\n62. Marty, supra note 1, at 47; see Cohen, supra note 1, at 28 (arguing that state laws lagged behind state constitutions); Curry, supra note 1, at 220 (regardless of the elimination of tax support for religion, “Americans inherited traditions of government interference in religious matters”); Stokes, supra note 1, at 143–58 (on various state laws supporting Christianity).\n63. See Jaher, supra note 1, at 121.\n64. See Borden, supra note 1, at 31, 98–103; Cohen, supra note 1, at 55–56; Jaher, supra note 1, at 139; cf. B.H. Hartogensis, Denial of Equal Rights to Religious Minorities and Non-Believers in the United States, 39 Yale L.J. 659 (1930) (tracing the notion that Christianity is part of the common law to Lord Coke).\n65. See Cohen, supra note 1, at 58–61; Jaher, supra note 1, at 138–39. Although not all American Jews opposed Sunday laws (see Borden, supra note 1, at 110), many did. For example, “Rabbi Isaac Leeser wrote before the Civil War that compulsory observance of Sunday was no different in kind from mandatory church attendance or involuntary baptism.” Cohen, supra note 1, at 5.\n66. Borden, supra note 1, at 113 (quoting City Council of Charleston v. Benjamin (1846)). For discussions of additional cases, see Blau \u0026 Barron, supra note 1, at 21–27; Borden, supra note 1, at 111–25; see, e.g., Updegraph v. Commonwealth, 11 Serg. \u0026 Rawl. 393 (Pa. 1822) (cited and discussed in Berman, supra note 1, at 781).\n",
