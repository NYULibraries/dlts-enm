            "pageText": "to each conflict was typical of the era in which it occurred.27 Although some believe that the United States, Britain, and France—who with Russia and China effectively control the Security Council, and hence the United Nations—“flunked” the test provided by Yugoslavia’s breakup, and reporters like Peter Jennings have implied that Washington’s failure to act led to enormous human suffering in Bosnia, most Western actions have been more calculated and cold-blooded.28 International organizations no longer seem to have clear functions, and some have adopted a brutal pragmatism. Thus General John Galvin noted that in 1991 NATO decided to become a “crisis manager” rather than intervene to end the crisis in Yugoslavia; the editor of Foreign Policy has discerned a certain efficacy in “ethnic cleansing”; and others have advocated a return to nineteenth-century colonialism.29\nWhereas Fascist Italy’s attack on Ethiopia in 1935 elicited almost universal disapproval, Serbia’s attacks on its neighbors in the early 1990s led to condemnation of those states pressing for recognition of Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia; they elicited criticism of the victims of Serbian aggression; and they spurred efforts to force Zagreb and Sarajevo to deal with Belgrade.30 In 1935, movements for sanctions against Germany were undercut by France and Britain, who wished to avoid war with another great power, but who at least proposed sanctions aimed at the aggressor and not at its victim. In late 1991, the major powers placed an arms embargo on both Serbia and its victims. The arguments used to justify doing so—that the conflict was a “civil war” and that more blood would be shed if more arms were introduced—were already threadbare in 1991 and have grown more so, but they are still regularly used to justify the arms embargo on Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia—all sovereign states with the right to defend themselves under international usage and the provisions of the UN Charter.31 That the great powers have actively denied them that right by imposing an arms embargo is the most obvious indicator that we are now in an age in which the will of the great powers takes precedence over principle, treaty, and custom.32 Such actions are reminiscent of the Spanish Civil War, but there is a crucial difference. While Spain served as a battleground for competing ideologies and the efforts to contain the war could be seen as an effort to try to avoid a more general European conflagration, the war in the former Yugoslavia is one of territorial aggrandizement, with only a very crude racial ideology justifying Serbian aggression. The containment, therefore, would be of genocide, not of war.\n",
