Besides, he was good, having been in prison hand rolling cigarettes on and off for half your life being bound to do something. And it seemed to make T.C. feel good to talk about dope. Or prison. Or anything. He considered himself, everyone knew, to be philosophical. Which was what else Holgate figured came from being locked up so long—all that time with nothing else to do but sit around and tell lies to people stupider than yourself. “Watch how I wet the end here,” T.C. said, and Holgate grinned at him and the others and lay back letting them talk about whatever they wanted; and after a while it was all right, almost like he was asleep but still awake right there in the sun until the next thing he knew someone was tapping him.
