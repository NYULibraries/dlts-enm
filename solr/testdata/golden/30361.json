Following on the testimony of industry insiders, Lee concludes that the era’s capricious laws and a series of ill-timed investments, particularly in export-targeted films, were the principal factors in the demise of Shin Films. The failure of the era’s savviest film entrepreneur to thrive within the new system was a clear indication—at least in retrospect—of the law’s shortsighted and dim view of cultural production and, it might be argued, the true repressiveness of its aims.\nBut Shin was not a passive victim of the 1970s legislation. While his studio did not score the triumphs it had achieved so consistently in the early 1960s, it adapted quickly to the new filmmaking environment and pushed out a remarkable number (a peak of sixteen in 1973) of films that, as the critic Yi Yŏn-ho noted in her interview with Shin, even looked foreign.76 Further, the existence of inventions such as the counterfeit coproductions, among a host of other ploys, demonstrates that there was ample play within the “Yusin” film laws, despite the fact that Shin and others would be caught and prosecuted for precisely those practices.77 That this play was primarily entrepreneurial and only minimally creative is nevertheless a critical point. The most salient argument to be made here, however, is that Shin’s work remained remarkably consistent through the last days of his South Korean career. That is, despite the magnified powers of the film censorship committees, and in the face of a geographically expanded market, Shin continued to make films that looked and sounded much like the work on which he had built his popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. Of the thirteen films he put together in the decade, three were war films, three were period pieces or historical treatments, three were women’s melodramas, two were horror films; one musical and one revenge farce round out the list. This is an even genre distribution that is roughly analogous to Shin’s output of the 1950s and 1960s. The work was also characteristically uneven politically: while some could be read as conservatively acquiescent (Yu Chi-na, for instance, argues that the 1973 Three Days’ Reign [Samil ch’ŏnha] marked a turn toward heroic patriotism themes in his period films),78 others were radically ambivalent. For instance, his 1974 Boy, 13 (13-se sonyŏn) bears none of the anticommunist rhetoric of The Han River (Han’gang), made in that same year, nor does it rest on the mildly surprising pacifism at the bottom of his 1964 Red Muffler.
