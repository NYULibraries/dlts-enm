Examples of disconnection included the ways that the black boys in chapter 5 were encouraged to leave their cultural identity outside the history classroom or how definitions of learning and progression in Yusuf’s home were designed to dovetail with school learning but did not (chapter 8).\n  28. The young people’s civility online was discussed in chapters 3 and 4. It may be that the very extensiveness of Facebook networks among this cohort—taking in nearly the whole class and, indeed, much of the year group as well as peers beyond the school—meant that it functioned as a kind of digital extension of school life. Not to be civil on Facebook to people in the class or to people you do not know very well would cause difficulties the next day at school. Most of the young people (although not all and not always) were keen to avoid the eruption of such difficulties within the closely managed, largely civil sphere of the school.\n  29. Arguably, it would have been more disheartening to find evidence of young people’s active embrace of competitive individualism, which for the most part we did not.\n  30. As noted in chapter 4, Strathern (1996) analyzes the necessity of “cutting the network” so that connections are limited and can, thereby, be deepened (rather than weak ties forever multiplied). In finding a balance between fewer deep or strong ties and more weak ties, the simple notion of connection becomes unhelpful. For instance, Smart (2007) frames connectedness not in terms of ever-extending networked individualism (Wellman and Rainie, 2012) but in terms of fewer deep relationships, prioritizing the same sense of local and familial embeddedness that we found to be important.\n  31. See, among others, Davies and Good (2009), US Department of Education (2010), OECD (2012), European Schoolnet (2013), White House (2013). For more critical approaches, see Buckingham (2007), Livingstone (2012), and Selwyn (2014).\n  32. Ofcom (2014).\n  33. Bruns (2008); see also Jenkins (2006) and Ito et al. (2013).\n  34. Jenkins (2006, 2012), Ito et al. (2013), Warschauer and Matuchniak (2010).\n  35. Buckingham et al. (2001) discuss families’ probably misplaced investment in all kinds of homework materials, home tutors, and “edutainment” technologies. Gutiérrez et al. (2010) examine middle-class families’ beliefs in the value of a busy schedule of enrichment activities. Lareau (2011) shows how middle-class families inculcate a sense of entitlement in their children along with the communicative skills to ensure they get what is on offer.
