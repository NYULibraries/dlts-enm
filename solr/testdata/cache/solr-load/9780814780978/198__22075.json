The reason that judges have an important role in the legal order is that the judiciary supplies to citizens the mechanisms that ensure that officials will be kept within the bounds of the law.\nHabermas does concede that this idea of the separation of powers cannot be institutionalized in watertight compartments. Because of the complexity of the administrative state, statutes must be concretized by both the judiciary and the administration, which means that neither can avoid the task of justification.32 \nHis point seems to be that when justification is at issue, when a decision has to be made about the content of a statute, that decision must be made as democratically as possible by allowing for full participation by the parties affected by it. The judge, whether it be the judge of a superior court or of an administrative tribunal, has a special role in this, in that he or she should bring to adjudication an impartial perspective. The judge must reach beyond the parties’ immediate articulation of their interests and consider the coherence of the pertinent legal materials as well as the interests of the audience beyond the courtroom.33 \nHabermas explicitly distances himself from what he regards as a misguided positivist quest for certainty through the determinacy of statute law. It is not that he thinks that certainty is without value. But he suggests that his understanding of law achieves certainty in two other respects.34 \nFirst, even though legal subjects might not have the certainty of knowing the content of the law in advance of an authoritative interpretation, they do have the certainty of knowing that this content will be determined in accordance with the appropriate procedures. Second, there is a certainty that results if we move away from Dworkin’s monological or individualistic understanding of interpretation to an understanding of how paradigmatic understandings of law influence judges collectively and stabilize judicial interpretation.\nHabermas identifies two main legitimate contenders for such judicial paradigms—the liberal and the welfarist paradigms. Both, he thinks, are legitimate bases for interpreting the law’s promise of equality. They are legitimate precisely because they are conceptions of what it takes to be a free and equal citizen of a legal community. But even though both are legitimate bases for interpretation, ",
