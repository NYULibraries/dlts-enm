            "pageText": "the news about the mounting tension in the area. I knew that war was coming, although even Israeli Intelligence didn’t, and I managed to get back to Israel on the eve of Yom Kippur, twenty-four hours before the outbreak of the war. I had these premonitions—they still give me the shivers.\nI called my friends on the base right away, and they told me that women and children were being evacuated to a safer location, and I could come with them. However, I couldn’t imagine being quarantined with all the wives and kids, waiting for the evening to get the casualty lists. … I invited one of my friends and her three kids to stay with me in my parents’ house in Tel Aviv.\nWe lived together for ten days, while I helped her take care of her kids. It was an awful period, and we were hysterical. After ten days we felt the need to be where everybody else was, to get the news firsthand. We went to the family camp and got an apartment to share. As I had imagined, it was indeed terrible. Every evening the officers came and announced the names of the dead men and the captives. We used to avoid being outside so that we wouldn’t see this trio of men with their horrible announcements.\nAt the same time my friend kept saying to me, “But for you, Yardi, it will all end in happiness, because when all this is over, Avi will come home.” I felt it was my chance, but I was worried that our victory over the Egyptians might lead to revenge on the prisoners. It could be an unhappy ending, and I was haunted by anxiety and the fear that my dream would never come true.\nThe war ended after all, and the month of the exchange negotiations too, and one night I got a call telling me to be ready for the POWs’ return the next morning. Naturally I didn’t sleep the entire night, and in the morning, the whole country was there at the airport waiting. Big confusion, little kids and everything and at 2:30 only a group of wounded prisoners arrived. It was. … the last straw after all this long waiting.\nI went home engulfed in grief. I asked not to be informed about their return until they were about to descend. And so it was. They called me the next day only after the list of POWs on the approaching plane was confirmed. I had an hour to get to the airport to receive Avi.\nSuch geniuses! The families were put in a distant hall, while the big shots from the Air Force and government could see them ",
