To conciliate heterosexual women, they reconsidered the word “collaborators,” which they had used to describe heterosexual women in the “Political lesbianism” paper: “We now think that ‘collaborators’ is the wrong word to describe women who sleep with men, since this implies a conscious act of betrayal. Even if applied solely to heterosexual feminists, rather than to heterosexual women in general, it is inaccurate: most feminists do not see men as the enemy, or heterosexuality as crucial to male supremacy” (1981:66). Thus, the Leeds feminists exchanged criticism of heterosexual women for paternalistic patience with women who were not to blame for heterosexual behavior that arose out of false consciousness. Anna Wilson, a member of the Onlywomen Press, was not willing to compromise even that much, “if you want to go on being heterosexual, that’s ok. but i want you to think about the fact that you’re doing it because you want to. you are responsible for being heterosexual” (1981:61).\nThe Furies and the staff of Purple September, whose arguments were very similar to The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group’s arguments, made similar clarifications. In the introduction to a collection of Furies writings, Myron and Bunch wrote defensively:\nSome feminists say that lesbians are “divisive to the women’s movement” by demanding that every woman be a lesbian. We are less concerned with whether each woman personally becomes a lesbian than with the destruction of heterosexuality as a crucial part of male supremacy. Lesbians have been the quickest to see the challenge to heterosexuality as necessary to feminists’ survival. However straight feminists are not precluded from examining and fighting against heterosexuality as an ideology and institution that oppresses us all. (1975:12)\nThe staff of Purple September agreed,\nfrom a feminist viewpoint it is indeed irrelevant whether feminists are straight or gay, but that is not the end of the story. Feminism does require that feminists critically assess the normative status of heterosexuality whether or not they abide by that norm in their personal lives. (Purple September 1975:82).\nIn other words, there is no necessary connection between one’s personal sexuality and one’s feminism; heterosexual women can also be feminists, that is, they can also challenge heterosexuality. “The real difference is ",
