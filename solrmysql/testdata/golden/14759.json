            "pageText": "The interventions were not seen as final rescue or emancipation—that came only after World War I, when American and other relief agencies joined in Armenian efforts to seek out and rescue surviving women and children. The outside intercession was nonetheless central and critical to the ultimate rescue. Thus, the stream of consciousness regarding intervention has always been part of survivor lore, yet never the subject for study or analysis.\nTHE ORAL HISTORY SAMPLE\nThis study is based on data derived from 527 oral history interviews with Armenian survivors (see table 12.1). The interviews have been conducted over the past twenty years as part of a course in Armenian oral history at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). A little explanation is in order. Keenly aware of the rapid disappearance of the survivor generation and with it the loss of first-hand accounts and valuable information about life before and during the cataclysm, I introduced a university course on oral history. For it I devised or adapted questions relating to the Armenian experience in the Ottoman Empire—home life, schools and professions, customs and holidays, social structures, intercommunity and intracommunity relations, and then the deportations and massacres, means of self-preservation, and finally rescue and relocation.\nThe questionnaire devised as a guide to the interviewer does not include direct questions about external intervention. This information has, by and large, been volunteered by the interviewees. Nonetheless, intervention is so important in the stories of the survivors that it may be safely assumed that nearly all such cases have been noted. Other qualifiers must be added. To date, only a few of the 527 interviews, more than 90% of which are in the Armenian language, have been transcribed, as the emphasis has been on the collection process. In the preparation of this study, I have relied on the written interview summaries filed by the interviewers in order to identify cases of probable intervention. From those summaries, 183 cases or 34.7% of the total of 527 interviews were deemed to include information on intervention. These figures should be regarded as minimal, because it is likely that some cases of intervention were not noted in the student summaries.\nOf the 183 interviewees who reported instances of intervention, ninety-six (52.5%) were males and eighty-seven (47.5%) were females. In listening to these selected 183 interviews, I tried to determine the place of origin and age of the interviewees, the ethnic identity and social and economic status of the interveners, and the motives for the interventions. I looked particularly for cases in which humanitarian or altruistic motivations were clearly dominant. Obviously, it is difficult to make determinations relating to the motives for intervention or to develop sociopsychological profiles of the personalities involved. Not only is it impossible to speak to the principals themselves, but the survivors’ explanations come more than half a century after the fact and may be colored or conditioned by time or by the stories of others.\n",
