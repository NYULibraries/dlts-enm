            "pageText": "The question of dreams in swan maiden and demon lover narratives raises an apparent contradiction. Those who write on the nightmare emphasize the isolated and isolating terror of the victim; despite “its universality,” the nightmare “remains a strictly individual experience.”73 But the lore of the incubus involves collective images mustered by the dreamer to explain or deal with the dream experience. Not only dream lore, then, but the folktales that invoke it require consideration of both the individual and collective nature of the incubus.\nTo the present time, the debate of Chaucer’s cock and hen on the subject of dreams and their meaning has not abated. A distinction remains between the naturalistic explanations of a dream (for example, the food eaten before sleep, or the random workings of the brain) and the insistence that dreams have meaning in the life of the dreamer.74 Rather than try to decide whether dreams give rise to traditions, or traditions to dreams, it may be more profitable—at least for the study of folklore and literature—to consider how the human experience of conflict between fantasy and reality creates a myriad of relationships among real life, dreams (of many sorts), aspects of religious beliefs, and the narratives people invent, adopt, and retain to deal with these. Jones cites Hobbes’s Leviathan to illustrate the premise on which he has based his study of nightmares and demonology: Hobbes had written that from ignorance of “how to distinguish Dreams and other strong fancies from Vision and Sense did arise the greater part of the religion of the Gentiles in times past that worshipped Satyres, Faunes, Nymphs, and the like; and nowadays the opinion that rude people have of Fayries, Ghosts, and Goblins, and of the power of Witches.”75 It has similarly been observed that in “all fairy tales and all mythology, a remarkable conformity to the deranged ideas of sleep occurs, and the stories of the lower races; as, for instance, those of Schoolcraft’s ‘Algic Researches,’ read far more like the recollection of bad dreams than like the worn ideas of a once pure religion, or of a poetical interpretation of nature.”76 Perhaps it is because at least sometimes dreams might be transformed into swan maiden and demon lover narratives that dreams themselves in these tales are not usually literal narrative motifs (perhaps the dream element is often taken for granted). Thus when a story specifically cites a dream to explain a character, it provides an opportunity to see how the storyteller perceives the relationship between private and public self.\nA Siberian folktale relates simply that there “was a girl who refused ",
