But when the time comes for him to marry and he finds himself alone with his bride, no sooner does he put his arm around her waist, “than she suddenly turned into a wolf and tore him in pieces. When she had done this, she turned again into the same girl as she was before,” one so out of touch with her own nature that she cannot explain what happened: “‘I don’t know,’ said she, ‘but I know this much, that I turned into a wolf and tore him, and then again I turned back into myself.’”154 Again, in “La Lupa” Verga works out these themes by splitting the female image between the dangerous mother and her docile, socialized daughter.\nThe vagina dentata motif found in many animal bride tales focuses not only on the dangers of female sexuality but also on the specific threat it poses to male sexuality. Typical in its basic outline is a story from the Kiwai Islands, which is untypical, however, in its suggestion that the attribution to woman of sexual evil may be an essential projection of male fear and suspicions, in this case revealed in a dream. A man is approached by a woman but declines to have sexual relations with her, “for her vulva was provided with sharp teeth and opened and closed continuously like a mouth. Again and again he tried to muster up courage but shrank back every time.” In anger, the woman attacks him and he flees into water after which he finds, “to add to his horror,” that he is threatened by a crocodile. Just as the animal is about to catch and to devour him, “he opened his eyes.”155 The complexities of the dream motif were discussed in chapter 5. However this story is read, it takes its place among those in which a man proves unable to summon the courage necessary to disenchant his animal mate.\nThat an unwary man will be literally or symbolically castrated by the animal woman is a theme in many stories, an example being the Thompson tale of a woman “of very handsome appearance and enticing manners,” who is accustomed to wander through the mountains where she offers herself to men who pass by, “every one [falling] victim to her wiles.” But her “privates were the mouth of a rattlesnake,” and thus “many hunters never returned home,” their “bones” becoming plentiful in the area where the wild woman roams.156 Similarly, in a Zuñi narrative, a young man is horrified by a snake that speaks gently enough to him, but will, he fears, bite him and devour his flesh while he sleeps.157 An Algonquin story tells how two girls are changed to water snakes ",
