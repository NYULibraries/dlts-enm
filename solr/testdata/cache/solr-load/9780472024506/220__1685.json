            "pageText": "\nthe PRC's conception of politics and journalism, when foreign reporters attempted to interview Zheng Enchong, a former human rights lawyer who served three years for illegally providing state secrets abroad, they were turned away by police. Although he was released last year, he is serving an extra year of “deprivation of political rights,” which means he is “not suitable for taking interviews” (Ching 2007) raising intriguing questions about the right to meet with foreign journalists as a condition of citizenship, a privilege that has been effectively denied all citizens under the old policies. Denying interviews based on deprivation of political rights is also a convenient mechanism by which officials can circumvent the new interview rules since some citizens can have their “right to be interviewed” revoked. In February 2007, the Central Propaganda Department banned news reporting on twenty specific issues in order to promote a “conducive atmosphere” in the lead up to the 17th Chinese Communist Party Congress. Mandates that only “ethically inspiring” programs be aired during primetime have also been imposed (Feuilherade 2007).8 The local government in Shandong province issued a document that urged all departments, organizations, and officials to “use all measures to downsize the impact of negative reporting to a minimum level” (BBC Monitoring International Reports 2007) in preparation for the challenge posed by relaxed media restrictions. Noting that measures to “block malicious information that might intensify social conflicts or uneasiness” has been a long-standing practice by local officials, a Chinese editor warned that reporters can't expect full transparency when the specter of negative news endangers their position (BBC Monitoring International Reports 2007) and provincial authorities (often with the cooperation of local business) often work together to prevent investigative reporting on potentially embarrassing issues.\nAlthough the CPJ and FCCC reports find that foreign journalists have had an easier time since the rules were relaxed (FCCC 2007, 1), travel and interview access is far from unproblematic. One day after the rules were announced, New York Times Beijing bureau chief Joseph Kahn and International Herald Tribune's Roger Cohen were detained and made to write “confessions” after interviewing a businessman in Hubei province (CPJ 2006a). While attempting to report on toys with possible lead contamination, New York Times reporter David Barboza, his translator, and his photographer were detained by the factory's private security officers, necessitating hours of negotiations before their release.
