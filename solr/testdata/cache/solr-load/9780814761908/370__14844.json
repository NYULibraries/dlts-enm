We then suggest its usefulness by applying it as the central focus for eight social processes that we deem essential for promoting extensive altruistic behaviors in diverse social institutions.\nEXTENSIVITY: A CONCEPTUAL ELABORATION\nAs we define it, extensivity means the tendency to assume commitments and responsibilities toward diverse groups of people. Extensivity includes two elements: the propensity to attach oneself to others in committed interpersonal relationships; and the propensity toward inclusiveness with respect to the diversity of individuals and groups to whom one will assume obligations.\nThe construct attachment is perhaps most familiar in the context that John Bowlby (1969) used and developed it. Based on his observations of infant-mother relationships, Bowlby concluded that the desire for proximity was a compelling drive among infants, and the ways mothers responded to this need became the prototype for all subsequent human relationships. Further research has amplified as well as modified some of Bowlby’s conclusions. Ainsworth (1967), for example, distinguished between securely and nonsecurely attached children, while yet others have concluded that Bowlby may have exaggerated the importance of the mother as an attachment figure, and that others, including fathers, other relatives, and even strangers could serve this purpose (Schaffer and Emerson 1964). What this research nonetheless shares in common is the assumption that attachment to some figure in infancy and early childhood is essential for healthy development. A sustained connectedness with an adult figure who provides security and stability in responding to children’s needs presumably shapes fundamental conceptions about trust and nontrust, self and other, relationships and autonomy.\nThat the need for attachment may be a life-long issue has been proposed by developmentalists in particular, although the concept of attachment is variously labeled. Communion is the term that Bakan (1966) used to describe connectedness with others; he argues that it, along with agency or individuation, is fundamental to all human experience. Kegan (1982) terms it subject relations—embeddedness in the other or joining of the self with the other—which he views as one of the two ongoing processes of making meaning ",
