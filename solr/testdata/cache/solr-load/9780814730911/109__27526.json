            "pageText": "energy is lost in the form of heat generated by resistance in the wire. A superconductivity cable could eliminate that loss, reducing the cost of electricity. Eliminating the heat caused by resistance could also make possible smaller and faster computers, because presently efforts to scale down computers are limited by heat production. Superconductors could also be used in electromagnets to generate intense magnetic fields, opening up possibilities, including magnetically levitated trains.61\nThere has been no shortage of media excitement over superconductivity—the media typically emphasizes scientific breakthroughs and often presents them in the most glowing form.62 And indeed, the race to make progress in superconductivity was an extraordinarily exciting human as well as scientific process, as ably conveyed in Robert Hazen’s The Breakthrough. But there will, of course, be difficult decisions down the road as superconductivity moves into technological applications.\nFor example, some of the recent advances in superconductivity have relied on materials that contain yttrium, a so-called rare earth. Yttrium is not, in fact, rare, and increased uses of superconductivity will require increased production of it. Yttrium is often found in monazite ore, which is presently mined and processed for various purposes. If superconductivity turns out to mean increased work with monazite ore, a rather dramatic example of the regulatory gap is in the offing. Monazite ore is a low-level radioactive compound. In April 1986, the same month the IBM physicists submitted their findings on ceramic superconductors, a federal court handed down a decision in ongoing litigation brought by William Merklin, an employee of Raw Earths, Inc.63 None of the breathless press accounts on superconductivity mention Mr. Merklin; indeed he did not work with superconductors or even with yttrium. But he did work on processing monazite ore and he did contract cancer of the larynx, throat, and lymph nodes, perhaps from his exposure to the radioactive ore. In the course of its decision, which held that Mr. Merklin might have a viable claim for damages, the court found that “radioactive monazite ore and its refined derivatives are dangerous products” for purposes of certain legal theories.64\nOf course, this particular risk with superconductivity may never come to pass. But it is quite likely that in practice the applications of superconductivity will raise a variety of health and safety issues. Thallium and mercury, for example, are other possible components in commercial superconductors, and both are quite toxic.65\n",
