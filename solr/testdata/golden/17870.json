One recent case accorded legal weight to such “Negrophobia” by holding that an ordinary person assaulted by an anonymous Black individual might develop a pathological fear of all Blacks sufficient to justify an award of disability benefits.1 Invoking the same psychological proposition, our defendant might contend that her Negrophobia is relevant to the reasonableness of her reactions to the supposed assailant.\nBecause the concept of reasonableness drives self-defense doctrine, each of these race-based arguments might result in a determination that the shooter should be excused for shooting the Black bank customer. Indeed, recent experience shows that defendants in self-defense cases often exploit the racial fears of jurors in asserting the reasonableness of their fear of supposed assailants who are Black.2 The meaning of race does not necessarily “speak for itself” in these cases; defense attorneys construe race in subtle and not-so-subtle ways with the goal of exonerating their clients. Homicide (and wrongful death) trials that center around race-based defenses, therefore, are telling crucibles in which to test the fairness of acting on racial fears.\nTo appreciate the growing acceptance of racially charged arguments of reasonableness in self-defense cases, one need go no further than the notorious New York subway vigilante case of People v. Goetz.3 The defendant, Bernhard Goetz, successfully claimed that his shooting of four Black teenagers on a crowded subway after two of them smiled at him and “asked” for five dollars was justified as an act of self-defense.
