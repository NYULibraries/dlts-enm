            "pageText": "the rights violation has not been redressed for generations. Does the grandchild, the great-grandchild. . . the n-th grandchild have the right to reclaim the stolen property? This is why our laws, both criminal and civil, have statutes of limitations that render claims stale with the passage of time. These limitations seem perfectly sensible, for they insist that if a person does not act to claim his lost possession within a reasonable amount of time, he and his heirs are forever barred from complaining. Intervening events, and the reliance of innocent third parties on legitimate transactions involving the stolen property, make it likely that others’ rights will be violated if we attempt to repair damages that are of ancient lineage.\nAs perplexing as these property rights violations are, they are the easy cases. What about claims to inherit the right to compensation for rights violations of the life and liberty sort. If slave A was killed by his master, does his heir unto the third, fifth, or n-th generation have a claim against the heirs of the master? The slave’s right to liberty was breached in almost every way imaginable, but can his great-great-granddaughter claim recompense from the heirs of the master, or more pertinently for our set-aside problem, from the government whose policies permitted and enforced slavery? I doubt that anyone can resolve these questions, other than by adopting the sensible solution devised by the common law judges: some rights violations lapse with time and, therefore, are uncompensable. It is impossible to right all the wrongs of the past, and to attempt to do so would surely mean that resources would not be available to compensate the victims of the present.\nCriterion I in Retrospect. A set-aside program of the Richmond variant would flounder on component (2), identifying the perpetrator and the victim, because it does not point to specific victims. Rather, it dispenses its compensation to anyone who can claim membership in six named, but no more closely defined, groups. Given the problems foreshadowed above with respect to blacks, seemingly the easiest group among whom victims could be found, it goes without saying that the problems are infinitely compounded when a group is identified only as Spanish-speaking.
