Satires mocking married men as both brutal tyrants and effeminate slaves became commonplace. Family men’s expectations that they should rule dependents were disappointed in some degree by wives’ agency and sons’ mobility. Some men reacted with an antimarital ideology; others channeled misogyny into revitalizing the traditional ideal; many experimented with the new alternatives; and most muddled through the confusion. Commentators worried that gender turbulence eroded men’s commitment to family life and intensified male licentiousness. They warned that men who failed to marry, refused family responsibility, or forswore legitimate fatherhood lacked proper self-restraint, engaged in destructive vices, and often lured sober men into depravity. The specter of masses of disorderly men causing chaos became more terrifying to civic leaders when the revolutionary rhetoric of liberty and equality weakened traditional restraints on male conduct and strengthened men’s claims to individual rights against authority.\nIn 1766, Jonathan Mayhew congratulated colonists for defending liberty against the Stamp Act but quickly condemned them for “riotous and felonious proceedings” compounded by cloaking their “rapacious violences with the pretext of zeal for liberty.” Mayhew warned that some American men had lost “all sense of religion, virtue, and good order” and caused a “state of general disorder approaching so near to anarchy” that they almost brought on “more dreadful scenes of blood and slaughter.” For the next forty years, public officials were haunted by visions of disorderly men indulging democratic desire as an excuse for venting passion and renewing earlier scenes of bloodshed and slaughter. It was not until 1805 that Thomas Jefferson was ready to declare a “union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course.” Even then, Fisher Ames warned that only “grown children” were so foolish as to believe that men’s licentiousness, factionalism, and mobbish conduct had been cured.47\nWhy were men so apt to transform claims to liberty and equality into disorderly conduct? A frequent explanation was that males were inherently passionate, ",
