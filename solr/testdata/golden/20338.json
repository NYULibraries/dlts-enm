Eisenstadt, ed., Max Weber on Charisma and Institution Building: Selected Papers (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968), 253.\n99. Weber, “The Prophet,” 254. Heschel writes of the prophet as anthropotropic (God turning toward man) while priests were theotropic (man turning toward God): “The prophet’speaks and acts by virtue of divine inspiration, the priest performs the ritual by virtue of his official status.” Heschel, The Prophets, v. 2, 221.\n100. Vawter, Conscience of Israel, 20. On prophecy as charismatic, see also: Heschel, The Prophets, v. 2, 139; Overholt, Channels of Prophecy, 24, 70, passim.\n101. In J. E. T. Eldridge, ed., Max Weber: The Interpretation of Social Reality (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1971), 229.\n102. This is clear in Weber’s writings where charismatic authority is contrasted with rational forms like bureaucratic authority, and it is the focus of William H. Swatos, Jr., “The Disenchantment of Charisma,” Sociological Analysis 42 (1981), 119–36. See also: George P. Boss, “Essential Attributes of the Concept of Charisma,” Southern Speech Communication Journal 41 (1976), 300–13.\n103. von Rad, The Message of the Prophets, 206, 218–28.

Bailey, The Tactical Uses of Passion (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1983), 38. Burke Long writes: “Even events of conspicuous hardship and failure could be interpreted so as to support claims of authority (Jeremiah 1:18–19; 15:19–20).” Long, “Prophetic Authority as Social Reality,” 15.\n107. von Rad discusses the use of “martyrdom” to describe pre-Christian sufferings and finds that examples from the Old Testament prophets approach very closely Christian martyrdom, “for even in Israel it became more and more apparent that loyalty to Yahweh logically would lead to suffering.” von Rad, The Message of the Prophets, 276f.\n108. James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 32. Shaw notes, “The test of sanity is not the normality of the method but the reasonableness of the discovery.” “Preface,” Saint Joan, 14.\n109. James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 37.\n110. James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 207. Writing of Saint Joan, Shaw says, “For us to set up our condition as a standard of sanity, and declare Joan mad because she never condescended to it, is to prove that we are not only lost but irredeemable.” “Preface,” 18.\n111.
