Novels such as The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) suggest broad fin de siècle interest in the disjunction between innocence and its outward appearance, but here Meade overtly connects this theme to the expanding feminine context of cosmetics and consumer fantasy. Sources indicate that Madame Rachel had not personally benefited from her beautification talents, but Meade depicts Sara as a strikingly lovely woman whose appearance is undoubtedly artificial and calculated. In “The Bloodstone,” Druce claims, “Sara, by her own showing, was an old woman, and yet … [her] face was brilliant, not a wrinkle was to be observed; her make-up was so perfect that it could not be detected even by the closest observer” (206). In Sara, the ostensible line between cosmetic artificiality and “genuine” beauty is obliterated. Druce knows she must be made-up, but cannot find evidence for it, which as a detective he finds maddening: “I hate all mysteries—both in persons and things. Mysteries are my natural enemies; I felt now that this woman was a distinct mystery” (“Madame” 390). Here, as in the Holmes series, the female criminal is an unstable element in the scientific system of criminal detection. Just as Francis Galton believed that fingerprints were but “faintly developed” in women (Finger Prints 59), making female criminals difficult to detect, Sara's cosmetics help her maintain a “distinct mystery” of identity that baffles her pursuers. Though it is primarily Sara's genius, rather than her appearance, that accounts for her criminal success, she repeatedly employs her image to escape punishment and avoid detection. Sara's manipulation of others' perception suggests that the cultural shift toward commercialized femininity can be advantageous for women, but Meade also depicts the desperation gripping Sara's clients, conveying the peril of inculcating a social duty of attractiveness in women.\nGLOBAL CONSUMPTION AND ANGLO-FEMINISM\nBy presenting Sara's cosmetically enhanced appearance as a tool of sympathetic appeal, Meade highlights a connection between the perception of virtue and the visual manifestation of whiteness in English society. In the first story, Druce and Vandaleur manage to have Sara arrested\n",
