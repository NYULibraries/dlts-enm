            "pageText": "merchant, gradually was drawn to leave his worldly position, of which he was quite fond, to follow Jesus and to explore more deeply his own religious and spiritual journey even as he served the poor of his day. One day, so the story goes, Francis was on the road between Assisi and Lazzaro, the location of the hospital that cared for those suffering from leprosy, an illness that in Francis’s time was viewed with fear and aversion. In the course of his journey, Francis met one of the patients from that hospital, and, in spite of the man’s appearance, he found himself deeply moved and drawn to him. Francis bent down and kissed the sick man, and, in so doing, he finally came in touch with himself—with himself as he was: limited, lovable and loved, capable of loving.\nIn the Franciscan tradition, this event is regarded as a key moment in Francis’s conversion, as a kind of turning point in his spiritual journey. It is noteworthy, too, that some of the hagiographers over the centuries attempted to “clean up” the story by changing the original account to read that Francis saw Jesus in the leper—and that’s what led him to embrace the man. But subsequent Franciscan scholarship has confirmed the original version: The story—and the teaching it reveals—remains as written.\nPerhaps this vignette reflects the central reality of the connection between our professional work as practitioners in the world of HIV mental health and our own human and spiritual journey. There is a gift for us in the work that is real, mysterious, and at some level priceless. Essentially, we are in service to our brothers and sisters with HIV-related illness not as some sort of distant benefactors but as fellow human beings on the same human journey. There is only a single work, really: The work with ourselves and the work with our patients or clients are one and the same.\nWorking with HIV-related illness, particularly in its later stages, encourages us to learn, ourselves, to live fully in the present moment, to let go of our strong need and desire to control, and to embrace the reality of impermanence and death. The work invites us to an awareness that carries with it a simultaneous mindfulness of what is going on in the person who is ill as well as what is going on in the inner world of the clinician. We become aware of our own fears, yearnings, doubts, and hopes. In short, we become aware of our own search for “the real thing.” Joseph Campbell (1988), the teacher and scholar who did such important work in the exploration of myth, suggests that the only really inexcusable sin is inattention, and Stephen Levine (1987) regularly reminds us that anything that is not brought to awareness cannot be healed.\n",
