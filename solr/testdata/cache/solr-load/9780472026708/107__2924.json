For the first time in the twenty-six-year history of the NEA’s periodic survey of Americans’ reading habits, overall reading rates both for adults and for eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds have risen instead of declined. Though each rate hovers distressingly just above the midpoint—50.2 percent for all adults and 51.7 percent for eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds—the increase in readers aged eighteen to twenty-four who read novels, stories, and poetry has turned around from a 20 percent decline in 2002 to a startling 21 percent increase in 2008. Even more encouraging is the generalized uptick in reading rates across racial lines among whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. Enjoying a 20 percent increase in readers since 2002, Hispanics have tallied the sharpest climb, with reading among African Americans levitating 15 percent. Although adult reading rates still languish behind 1982 levels, literary reading among all American adults grew by 7 percent between 2002 and 2008, after twenty years of steady declines.30\nMy own experience with public poetic outreach suggests there’s a surprisingly pervasive social yearning for poetry.
