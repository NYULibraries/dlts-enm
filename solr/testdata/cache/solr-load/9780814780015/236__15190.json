            "pageText": "enable a person to follow [emphasis theirs] the service does not appeal to us; some of the service must reach the heart and that is only possible when the language of prayer is understandable to the person.”11\nThe Endeavorers were soon to find that their position was actually more traditional than that of at least one outspoken lay leader of the Orthodox Union. (Like the Seminary, the Orthodox Union had long-standing ties with the JES.) Lewis N. Dembitz, Orthodox Union vice-president, entered the fray with the remark that “on the language question … both of you [the American Hebrew and the Endeavorers] are wrong.” But as he developed his rambling thoughts, it became clear that he was less sympathetic to the JES than to their interlocutors. Dembitz dismissed the objection that “putting any of the obligatory parts [emphasis mine] of the ritual in English … would drive off the parents of the young folks entirely.” He evoked as his prooftext for a minimal use of English in the service “the express words of the Mishna (Sota, vii:1) that the Prayer and the ‘Shema’ is lawful in any language.” But he was not opposed to a possible alternative direction more akin to JES’s. “Perhaps,” he wrote, with the needs of the older generation in mind, “the matter might be compromised by only having a Methur-geman [translator] for the prophetic lessons and some parts of the Sedrah and by singing some English hymns.” Dembitz’s advice was to let “the matter take shape according to the tastes and desires of those who attend the services.” If all could not agree on every detail for a single Orthodox service, he concluded, “downtown is big enough for two or three such synagogues.”12\nThe JES’s intention to adhere to a strict version of Orthodoxy—stricter than Dembitz’s—was often lost on downtown’s older generation and its rabbis, who did not appreciate the delicacy of the JES stance. Years after his involvement with the JES, Mordecai Kaplan would remember the unhappiness of an immigrant father who chastised his son for attending Endeavorer Saturday afternoon services in the Henry Street Synagogue. “You are a shaigetz [for attending],” the father apparently said, “and Kaplan is a bigger shaigetz for conducting the prayers.” The “orderly fashion” of the prayers, Kaplan allowed, had in itself rendered the JES “treif.”13\nRabbi Jacob David Willowski must have seen Endeavorer sensitivities ",
