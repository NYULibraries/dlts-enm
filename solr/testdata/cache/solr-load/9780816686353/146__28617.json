Pombo (R-CA) thus introduced the “Temporary Agricultural Worker Amendments of 1996,” which established a new temporary visa category for unskilled agricultural workers (H-2B visas). According to the Pombo Amendment, agribusinesses would be allowed to petition for foreign workers after they established that they had been unable to hire an “able, willing, and qualified United States worker.” Employers had to pay “not less than the prevailing wage for similarly employed workers.” However, the Pombo Amendment clarified that this provision “does not require an employer to pay by the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed” (United States Congress, House, March 21, 1996). In other words, employers were allowed to pay a piece rate, deduct money for housing expenses, and charge their workers for the food that they received. Even more important, employers had to establish a so-called trust fund to assure that the temporary workers would return to their home countries after their work permit expired. Each employer was expected to withhold 25 percent of the worker’s wages. This amount would only be made available to the worker after he had returned to his home country. As an additional insurance against possible problems and additional expenditures, Representative Pombo made it clear that H-2B workers would not be allowed to bring family members, were not eligible for public services, and were even expected to reimburse the government for any emergency medical services that they had received.42 In short, the Pombo Amendment wanted to make sure that temporary workers did indeed behave like ideal neoliberal subjects who contributed to the system without ever burdening the U.S. taxpayer.43\nMany politicians were appalled. Even though the majority actually agreed that, without some kind of guest-worker program, H.R. 2202 had the potential to cause a widespread labor shortage for agriculture and certain other sectors, not everyone was prepared to create a new class of disenfranchised workers. Kika de la Garza (D-TX), for example, admitted, “Under ordinary circumstances, I would be interested in supporting an amendment of this nature. . . . But in the spirit in which we are dealing here today, to me it is insulting, it is demeaning. These will be indentured servants in the United States of America, indentured to individuals who will withhold under law 25 percent of their pay, maybe or maybe not get housing or be charged for housing or forced to buy it at the ranch store ",
