It seems to me it is outrageous.\nDr. Hutchinson’s studies should make the taxpayers as well as his monkeys grind their teeth. In fact, the good doctor has made a fortune from his monkeys and in the process made a monkey out of the American taxpayer.\nIt is time for the Federal Government to get out of this “monkey business.” In view of the transparent worthlessness of Hutchinson’s study of jaw-grinding and biting by angry or hard-drinking monkeys, it is time we put a stop to the bite Hutchinson and the bureaucrats who fund him have been taking of the taxpayer.39\nIn fact, studies of primate aggression could have beneficial medical implications for humans. But it is sometimes easier to make fun of the studies than to understand them. In the hands of a politically minded president, any number of science projects could be subject to similar ridicule. Fortunately for the science community, the item veto does not presently seem likely to become a reality.\nThe Virtual Absence of Judicial Review\nGiven the absence of a Department of Science or a line item veto, the primary engine of basic science for the present and the foreseeable future is the administrative agency, limited only occasionally by Congress and the president. The question then becomes the role of the courts. In this situation, which arises throughout American life in areas ranging from social welfare to the regulation of health and safety, there is a standard legal approach that defines the nature of judicial control of agencies. The relevant area of the law is called administrative law, and it is familiar to attorneys as one of the most ubiquitous and important branches of our legal system. It is typically here that the cautious process values of the legal profession come into play. Yet as we review the basic ideas of administrative law as they apply to science funding, we will see that such funding receives unusually favorable treatment in the courts.\nPursuant to a variety of statutes, most importantly the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, agencies must follow certain procedures in making their decisions and must be able rationally to justify the results they reach. To enforce these rules, an agency decision is almost always ",
