            "pageText": "has just as often been figured as a remnant of the past. In virtually every period of major cultural transformation, critics and filmmakers alike have declared the obsolescence of enlightenment thought and style. Yi P’il-u, who is widely seen as Korea’s first film impresario, was steadfast in the early 1920s in calling for the new “entertainment” medium to replace the “outmoded forms of the nineteenth century.”1 In a complex and troubling turn away from his commitment to socialist thought, Im Hwa, perhaps the leading cultural critic of the 1930s, pointed to the end of the age of “enlightenment idealism” and announced the dawn of “cultural industrialization” that ensued with the expansion of Japanese imperial power.2 In the mid-1950s, following the war and in the midst of increased American cultural influence, there was nearly unanimous agreement among critics that the world had changed and that the old forms of cultural instruction were no longer relevant.3 The same sort of rhetoric flooded newspapers and magazines in the 1980s, when the modicum of wealth and security built under the developmentalist projects of the Park Chung Hee administration and the apparent victory of the capitalist South over the socialist North seemed to negate the utility of ideological and instrumentalized cultural forms. The logic of this disavowal and assurance is twofold. It stems first from the link made between enlightenment and the premodern. Critics throughout the twentieth century continually tied the basic idea of kyemong to the moralistic literary culture of the defunct Chosŏn yangban class. Enlightenment, therein, was the antithesis of the modern subjectivities and democratic social forms that apparently lay at the core of contemporary filmmaking. It is rooted, second, in the more sophisticated idea that while enlightenment was in fact eminently modern in its utopian ideological objectives, it was now retrograde and inappropriate to the political calm that had ostensibly settled on the nation. The enlightenment film was therein an artifact of more troubling times and its overcoming signaled the arrival of a genuinely cosmopolitan Korean society.\nI want to argue in this chapter, however, that no such overcoming ever occurred, and rather that these moments of rhetorical disavowal only articulated shifts in the continued predominance of enlightenment thought in the discourses and practices of Korean cinema. Certainly, periods of acute political mobilization witnessed the agitation of interests that intensified the spirit of enlightenment: the enactment of laws governing content or mandating the number of films being produced and venues for their exhibition; the preference given to or pressure placed on critics and ideologues ",
