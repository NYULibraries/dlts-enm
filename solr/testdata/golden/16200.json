Remarkable changes in law enforcement methods, commitments, and technology occurring over the last three decades will make it impossible for organized crime to operate in its traditional way.\nNotes\n1. United States ν. Santana, 503 F2d 710 (2d Cir 1974).\n2. A later prosecution, United States ν. Adamita, 88 CR 217 (SDNY 1989) (known popularly as “Pizza Connection II”), charged fourteen additional individuals with participation in the Pizza Connection conspiracy. The trial, in which presiding judge Sprizzo harshly criticized the prosecution for the unsupported breadth of its charges, was a setback for the government. Seven of the defendants were acquitted by Judge Sprizzo at the conclusion of the government’s case; two were acquitted by the jury; four were convicted of heroin distribution and conspiracy to distribute heroin, and one was convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin.\n3. The indictment contained sixteen counts: count one charged all the defendants with conspiring to import and distribute narcotics; counts two through eleven each charged single defendants with engaging in and managing a “continuing criminal enterprise”; count twelve charged fifteen defendants with conspiring to transport money out of the United States without filing currency transaction reports; count thirteen charged six defendants with causing false statements concerning various cash deposits to be made to the IRS; count fourteen charged fifteen defendants and count fifteen charged ten defendants with failure to file currency transaction reports and international currency transaction reports; and count sixteen charged thirty-one defendants with a RICO conspiracy, specifically, conspiring to conduct and participate in, through a pattern of racketeering activity, an enterprise that engaged in international drug trafficking and money laundering.\n4. The Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute (CCE), United States Code, vol. 21, sec. 848, prescribes severe penalties—up to twenty years’ imprisonment and $2 million in fines for a first offense and thirty years and $4 million for subsequent offenses, plus forfeiture of any criminal proceeds—for any individual proven to have committed a continuing series of violations of federal drug law while (1) occupying a supervisory position with respect to five or more persons, and (2) deriving substantial income from the illegal activity. Along with the RICO statute, CCE has played an important role in the government’s campaign against the upper echelons of organized crime.\n5. For a history of Mafia politics, see Henner Hess, Mafia and Mafiosi: The Structure of Power (Heath, 1973).\n6. This section draws heavily on Ralph Blumenthal’s detailed account, Last Days of the Sicilians: At War with the Mafia—The FBI Assault on the Pizza Connection (Random House, 1988).\n",
