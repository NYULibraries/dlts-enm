            "pageText": "the image of woman reveals a need to reexperience the earliest of infant perplexities about self and not-self; that is, it represents a need to go back to the schizoid stage, what Melanie Klein called the paranoid-schizoid stage, in order to explore the problem of whether love is dangerous and is liable to consume the other and annihilate her. In Raskolnikov’s urgent need to find out whether he is vermin or human, he has to act out the fantasy of the schizoid problem—or, we can say, Dostoevsky did. Dickens, in his relational difficulties and his problems with reality, had what I believe we must call schizoid problems. Of course, he also tackles depressive problems—problems of a later stage relating to the dangers of hate and the need to make reparation for the possible consequences of hate. But we may take as indicative the recurring problem in Dickens of characters who cannot cope with moral issues in life because of what the psychotherapists call “diminution of affect”—emotional deficiency. Louise and Tom Grad-grind cannot find the capacity for ethical living because they have never had a rich imaginative experience of play, in love. Florence Dombey is threatened with serious emotional damage when her cold father destroys his image in her heart. Estella reveals a schizoid degree of emotional deficiency.\nIn Great Expectations I believe Dickens digs down in his fantasy to the earliest fears of loving and to deep, related schizoid problems of identity. The book is full of images of inner emptiness: Estella warns Pip that she has no heart (and such emotional emptiness could not, in reality, be the product of Miss Havisham’s persuasions). Miss Havisham has been blighted emotionally just at the moment of sexual flowering, and her bodily life in an ancient bridal gown symbolizes psychic paralysis. The convicts who are central to the theme of authenticity in the book are outcasts, and have no place in society: Magwitch is desperate to have a real identity and tries to make Pip into his false image of a gentleman. The book is also full of paranoid feelings, starting with the menacing opening that we have looked at: throughout there is a fear of lurking menace, from Compeyson or Orlick, from the punitive authorities who are seeking the convicts, and from the strange murderess lurking in the background, while in the phantom of a hanging woman that Pip sees from time to time there seems to be a more terrible threat from woman. The attack on Pip’s sister and Orlick’s attack on him are horrible paranoid-schizoid fantasies, while Magwitch’s death is dreadful, being a consequence of his impulse to remake a “proper” identity through Pip.\n",
