            "pageText": "sistible if irritable charms, some fiend possessing intractable powers, burrows his way inside our kids’ heads and hearts and spirits. This devil with candy in his pocket convinces them poetry is suddenly too vapid, too sissy foo-foo, too follow-the-rules-or-die, too gray about the fat man’s temples, too scented of blue-haired ladies’ lilac sachet, too bereft of life-giving sass and funk, too pinky-pointing polite, too Sunday-pulpit, too ruler-across-my-knuckles-please-shoot-me-and-end-this-nightmare. The plague is more fatal to boys than to girls. In seventh grade, even guys in gym shoes and jerseys come to hear my poems. They shake my hand and laugh in the right places. They admit they’ve written some themselves, “Wanna hear one?” They say they like mine about South Park. By ninth grade, it’s down to the one black-jeaned and disaffected, the skinny guy cut off from the herd, circled by frothed hyenas his parents and teachers simply can’t see. Too often the poetry we teach and the way we teach it summon The Man’s poetry anti-Christ.\nTwo worthy solutions are to put forward poems kids can relate to and to supplement text with audio as well as video poetry so students can see and hear poets perform, aspects of Web sites I’ve created as Illinois poet laureate to serve students and teachers: http://www.poetlaureate.il.gov and http://www.bradley.edu/poet. A bevy of other Web sites, poetry CDs and DVDs, and contemporary anthologies gather poems suitable for use in middle and high school classrooms, where, admittedly, graphic sexuality and undue profanity will earn both parents’ and the school board’s censure. Teachers can pick and choose from a range of modes and styles in anthologies as various as the experimental The North Anthology of Postmodern Verse and as accessible as Poetry 180 (and its follow-up 180 More).6 Here are two poems among hundreds I might have chosen to illustrate my assertion that poems can appeal to diffident teenagers. The first is Tony Hoagland’s “Dickhead,” a piece recounting a teenage boy’s vulnerability and the defense found in slinging around the pack’s edgy lingo. Here’s the opening flourish:\n \nTo whomever taught me the word dickhead,\nI owe a debt of thanks.\nIt gave me a way of being in the world of men\nwhen I most needed one,\n \nwhen I was pale and scrawny,\nnaked, goosefleshed\n \n",
