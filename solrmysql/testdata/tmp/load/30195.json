Our analysis here seeks to extend such important insights by retaining a focus on embodiment within the context of virtual migration.\n27. Anzaldúa (1987) sees borderlands as sites of contradiction, confusion, and ambivalence. Although the borderlands is traditionally imagined as the southwest territory of the United States–Mexico border, the space of call center labor creates a deterritorialized borderlands that exists both in virtual space and in the material terrain of people’s lived experience.\n28. “The image, the imagined, the imaginary—these are all terms that direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as a social practice,” Appadurai argues ([1996] 2000, 31). On the basis of this insight, he offers a series of “scapes” that serve to connect people imaginatively, even across tremendous distance. The ethnoscape is the landscape of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live, such as tourists, immigrants, refugees, exiles, guest workers, and other moving groups and individuals. Such groups “constitute an essential feature of the world and appear to affect the politics of and between nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree… . The warp of these stabilities is shot through with the woof of human motion, as more persons and groups deal with the realities of having to move or the fantasies of wanting to move” (33). The technoscape is the global configurations of fluid technology that moves across previously impervious boundaries; financescape is the movement of global capital, which moves across nations rapidly, impacting and impacted by currency markets, national stock exchanges, and commodity exchanges. Mediascapes refer to the distribution of electronic capabilities necessary to produce and disseminate information; these capabilities are now available to a growing number of private and public interests throughout the world, as are the images of the world created by these media. Ideoscapes are those images that are “directly political” (36) and frequently have to do with the ideologies of states and the counterideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it. These scapes converge within call center labor to generate a new scape: virtualscape. What is distinctive about the virtualscapes that call center agents engage is that they mobilize and participate in these previous scapes through a compulsory performance of Americanness, consumed through mediascapes and ideoscapes within the virtual space of the phone call (a technoscape). One may participate in a form of assimilation within an ethnoscape while remaining within the homeland.\n29. India’s adoption of economic liberalization policies in 1991 opened the door for Western products and media to proliferate—which they did, within a very short period of time. Indians thus quickly went from having access to a limited state-run television system to suddenly being able to access and watch tens of channels in a privatized satellite television universe. The sudden media presence of networks like MTV,",
