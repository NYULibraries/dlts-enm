It also served to reassure members of ethnic and/or racial minority groups that they, too, could become celebrated contributors to the French popular cultural scene—if they were willing enough to comply with the rules of French cultural integration.\nBeyond Localization: The Local/National/Global as Mutually Constitutive Elements\nThe above discussion illustrates how a global format can be localized to resonate with local audiences and even reconcile viewers with contested aspects of the socio-cultural landscape into which it is adapted. Focusing solely on this process of “localization of the global,” as most studies of transnational media tend to do, only provides, however, a limited outlook on the negotiation of the local/global nexus in globalized cultural texts such as the one examined here. Identifying the defining lines along which a global format was turned into a “French” text (as I endeavored to do in the section above) is a necessary first step in recognizing the political nature of processes of localization. The next step, if we are to better understand the mutually constitutive nature of the local/national/global nexus, requires us to further locate this process within the larger context of the awareness of the global that characterizes our contemporary condition.\nFirst of all, one must understand that the process of “localization” described above was actually one of “nationalization.” While the show’s narrative nodded at regional differences, these were brought together under the broader umbrella of a hegemonically defined national French identity constructed through the celebration of a “shared” cultural heritage—French songs, cultural icons, Catholicism, and so forth. Like any hegemonic definition, it had to be negotiated to integrate potentially contentious elements into its naturalization of the status quo. Thus, the French version of Star Academy sketched an idealized version of France as a nation in touch with its traditions yet open to new forms of cultural production (even ones arising as expressions of racial or ethnic difference), as long as these were safely integrated within an acceptable vision of French national unity. The “fiction réelle” [real fiction] (Jost, 2002/2007, p. 9) constructed in the show was one where France’s policies of color blindness actually worked.\nPerhaps more significantly, at least in terms of this chapter’s main argument, this idealized vision of French national identity was constructed in relationship to the show’s active engagement with an imagined global community. Despite its emphasis on various elements of “French” culture, a sharp awareness of this broader global framework permeated the entire discourse of the show. These transnational links were made particularly evident on the Friday\n",
