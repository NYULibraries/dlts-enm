            "pageText": "As horrendous childhood “memories” flooded her consciousness, R.N.’s condition became acute. Already his most demanding and difficult patient, her case occupied much of Ferenczi’s attention. Driven by what Freud called his furor sanandi (rage to cure), Ferenczi regularly saw R.N. four to five hours each day, as well as weekends; at her home and at night, if necessary. He even continued her analysis during vacations abroad. (This may sound extreme, but at that time it was not uncommon for analysts to see patients during their vacations.)\nNot surprisingly, Ferenczi’s attentions convinced R.N. that she had found her “perfect lover.” Faced with this development, Ferenczi retreated and began to “limit [his] medical superperformances” (1985, 98). As he did so, he interpreted for R.N. that she now ought to hate him. However, R.N. countered with her own interpretations—that Ferenczi harbored hidden feelings of anger and hate toward her, and that these feelings blocked her analysis. Until she analyzed those feelings in him, she said, the analysis would remain at an impasse. Even though he conceded that R.N.’s interpretations were justified, Ferenczi resisted her demand. Finally, after a year, he reluctantly submitted to her analysis of him (99).\nOn the couch, Ferenczi confessed “I did hate the patient in spite of the friendliness I displayed” (99). Expecting the worst, he was surprised by R.N.’s reaction. He wrote: “The first torrent of the patient’s affects (desire to die, notions of suicide, flight) is succeeded, quite remarkably, by relative composure and progress in the work: attention becomes freer of exaggerated fantasies …. Curiously this had a tranquilizing effect on the patient, who felt vindicated” (11, 99).\nFerenczi felt afraid, humiliated, and exposed by his self-disclosures, yet he was intrigued by what they produced: “Once I had openly admitted the limitations of my capacity, she even began to reduce her demands on me. … I really find her less disagreeable now …. My interest in the details of the analytical material and my ability to deal with them—which previously seemed paralyzed—improved significantly” (99). As a patient, Ferenczi had the valuable experience of being subjected to his own analytic technique (surely, at some point, every analysand’s revenge fantasy), aspects of which he didn’t like. “The mechanical egocentric interpretation of things by the analyst [R.N.] touched me in a highly disagreeable way …. However, this is the method this patient has learned from me” (96).\n",
