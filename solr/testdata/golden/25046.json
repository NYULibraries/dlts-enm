            "pageText": "need of redemption; it convinces her that she is unworthy of feeling safe or being valued and respected. Lack of validation is one of the deepest developmental deprivations a child can suffer, and yet, because of parental betrayal and emotional abandonment, it is the most common wound known to survivors of incest.\nAs I have said elsewhere, grief, guilt, and shame are chronic states for a survivor of incest. It is believed that guilt imposed on the victim by the perpetrator is taken in at the level of the perpetrator’s offense.36 He disavows his own guilt and transfers it to the victim who is left with the feeling that it is she who must atone for the offender’s behavior. His sin is now her sin. As children and even as adults, many survivors turn to their perpetrators for forgiveness. Redemption is something a survivor tries to secure by earning her abuser’s love through obedience.37 Like their prayers for deliverance from God, their perpetrator never redeems them. The perpetrator’s shame and God’s silence leave the child-victim with the sense that she is unredeemable. Ironically, most survivors continue to cling to the hope of an external rescue.\nIn Christian circles, the child will hear of freedom from suffering only in metahistorical terms. Her present experience must make sense to her, so she believes there must be something bad about her that is worthy of such abuse. Such internalization of someone else’s sexual crime halts movement toward resolution of the abuse.38 It also works to circumvent the process of seeking justice; muteness is always the enemy of authentic change.39\nWhen a survivor makes a public complaint or accusation regarding the offender’s activities, she defies the perpetrator’s attempt to silence and isolate her, and she opens the possibility of finding new allies.40 The survivor may come to understand her own legal battle as a contribution to a larger struggle, in which her actions may benefit others as well as herself. In later stages in their recovery process, some survivors have found that working within the system to defend the rights of women and children has helped them transform their personal grievance into a focused resistance to all forms of violence.\nWhen a survivor stands up in private, she draws power from her ability to speak the truth without fear of the consequences. She knows that truth is what the perpetrator most fears. As she refuses to obey the offender’s rules, she breaks the silence of his secret, and in so doing she may, in fact, redeem herself.\n",
