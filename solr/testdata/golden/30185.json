            "pageText": " that PREPS is trying to make fools of us. Actually, don’t you read [the] papers? Everywhere they are saying that people are losing jobs. Who is saying that getting jobs is easy? You may know all the local gundas [goons] and politicians. I need a job, and I need a job badly. And why should it be free? Will PREPS employees take home the salary we make? All of us have no problem in paying 200 rupees for a movie ticket, but no chance we will pay these people for a job?” Raja and Shree realized Manoj was right, and they both decided to take the PREPS assessment and competency tests. (Laveena, I2U, personal interview, 2009)\n\nThe character of Manoj leverages horizontal affective power as a neoliberal logic to interpellate Raja and Shree. By virtue of its representation in the film, his speech is designed to hail the students who are invited to identify with the group’s wise choice to invest the 200-rupee fee. These rhetorical choices both engage and then undercut student resistance. They are strategically incorporated across mediated and material training practices. Neoliberalism’s multiply mediated pedagogies are leveraged to guide students to the right answer: pay the fee, roll the dice, invest in your success, get a job.\nFor diasporic subjects like Laveena, the project of Indian nation building entails the active cultivation of network geographies: leveraging the virtual in order to cultivate neoliberal subjects, practices, and sites at home. The middle-class youth she targets do not necessarily, as we argue in chapter 4, have the opportunities or even the desire to live abroad. Yet their formation as virtually diasporic subjects is a critical component of their capacity to serve global capitalism. One prong of Laveena’s vision is to “make them aware of what is going on in the world”:\n\nFor example, I want an assignment saying go to NPR, listen to a piece that has been put in there. Put on NPR, download it, listen to it. Now suddenly they get exposure to NPR to an American accent, they get exposure to world news. Then get them to go to BBC, get them to do an assignment on who the world’s classical musicians are. Because I think that’s really what makes someone aware of multiple, different things—to become a rounded personality and be better at jobs. It’s not really book knowledge that makes someone really good as a long-term, high-potential employee, right? (Laveena, I2U, personal interview, 2009)\n\n",
