            "pageText": "spirituality to materiality (as well as temporality and carnality) arose from the early Christian efforts to differentiate and condemn Judaism. Thus, predictably, Gregory VII relied explicitly upon the Christian ideology of antisemitism to support his condemnation of the temporal powers of kings and princes. Moreover, just as the early Christians effectively increased their political power by denouncing Jews, the Church of the Investiture Struggle successfully enhanced its power by denigrating the (implicitly Jewish) carnality of the temporal and material world. Even as the inchoate secular state emerged to share power with the ascendant Church, the state inherited the degraded position of Jews within the universal body of Christianity. Thus, most Christians supposedly found spiritual fulfillment in the Church but nonetheless needed protection from the potential dangers and depravities inherent in the temporal and material world—the world of the Jews and the state.\nTHE LATER MIDDLE AGES\nChristian Power and the Persecution of Jews\nPerhaps more so than any other political action, a successful declaration of war manifests supreme authority and control. Hence, soon after the Investiture Struggle, the papacy displayed its enormous strength by launching the Crusades, wars to establish the Christian City of God throughout this world. In 1095, a papal proclamation initiated the first Crusade, and the next year, bands of Christian warriors set forth.67 The professed purpose of the first Crusade was to recapture Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulcher from the Saracens, while the avowed goal of the second Crusade (launched in 1146) was to defend the recently captured Holy Lands against potential Saracen attack. Despite these nominal objectives, however, both of these Crusades—especially the first—rapidly degenerated into a war against all heretics and infidels, particularly Jews.68\nThroughout the Crusades, the papacy claimed to continue its earlier policy of not forcing Jewish conversion. Nonetheless, as the Crusaders crossed Europe, they slaughtered Jews in one pogrom after another. Often, Crusaders formed ill-disciplined armies, little more than Christian mobs, bent on avenging the death of Jesus.69 These armies were unconcerned with the niceties of Christian doctrine, such as the notion that true faith cannot be coerced. Thus, the mobs repeatedly forced Jews to choose: “baptism or death.”70 During the first Crusade, the Christian armies declared:\n\n",
