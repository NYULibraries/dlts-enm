            "pageText": "\nthe government, has been very good about responding to their fellow Americans, and the foundations and businesses and individuals that were willing to send money allowed us, in that first year, to create new events. We did a Festiva Latina; we're very committed to seeing how we can rebuild our relations with Latin and Central America, bringing our Latin jazz and Latin musicians together, creating a celebration, and we did that.\nAK: Do you think there are sufficient resources around to keep the artists, and perhaps you want to speak especially to the musicians since that is closest to what you do, in town? Can they make a living?\nDM: Well, there's always been that challenge of earning a living here whether you are a visual artist, or certainly actors and dancers or musicians. The double-edged sword of New Orleans is that we are so rich in artistic talent but so poor. So before Katrina there was always that grumbling from the music community that “we have to leave New Orleans to make a living, we have to travel.” Well, that's the reality of the situation. Even if you're a musician in New York, you have to get out of there if you are going to make a living, so certainly right after Katrina there was this major awakening to what had happened. The clubs were down. There were no audiences. I think we're seeing certainly, a year and a half, two years after Katrina that all that's coming back. Now there will be musicians and artists who have moved away, have found other realities, other lifestyles; maybe they want to get back. We have so many houses that are still ungutted and unfinished, but it's amazing, I think, at this point when you look at the music community right today it's pretty phenomenal that 80 percent of it, 85 percent of it is back. The challenge is going to be more of . . . the musicians have access to touring, they have access to creating a product that sells for $15.99 or 99 cents on iPod, local performances—people do like to go out and party—but when you are a visual artist and you're trying to go out and sell a unique product that you've created that reflects you finding your market is very difficult, and I think that the decline in conventions, more than tourism, has had a brutal impact on the visual arts community. Theater seems to be coming back. Now theater has never really funded the performers properly. We do a lot of community theater here, we do a lot of twenty-dollar-a-night type things. I think one of the major reasons theater has never grown to be a major force in New Orleans, in spite of Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman, and everyone else, is that we're not looking at the economics of it so that there is sustainability. Some of that is changing, and we do have Southern Rep and Tulane Shakespeare, but there still needs to be a little bit more there.\n",
