            "pageText": "Black Atlantic as a “counterculture of modernity.” These approaches all engage with ongoing debates on modernity and utilize discourses on oppression not to separate identities but to elucidate how historically they have been inextricably bound in various forms and degrees of social antagonism. This antagonism has not disappeared. And in academia, as I have already mentioned, it gets played out in combinations of academic and professional strategies and decision-making processes.\nYet even if we all admit that this antagonism persists, we must still find a way to address and critique one another constructively. Toward this goal, I agree with Satya Mohanty when he makes the following point in a special issue of PMLA on colonialism and the postcolonial condition. His words apply equally well to our focus on identity and credibility:\n\nFor we can learn from others only if we take them seriously enough to imagine situations in which they may in fact be wrong about some things in the ways that we can specify and understand. The version of multiculturalism that demands that we suspend judgment on purely a priori grounds offers at best a weak pluralist scenario of noninterference and peaceful coexistence that is based on the abstract notion that everything about the other culture is (equally) valuable. Given the lack of understanding or knowledge of the other, however, the ascription of value (and of equality among cultures) is either meaningless or patronizing. Genuine respect depends on a judgment based on understanding, arrived at through difficult epistemic and ethical negotiations. (113)\n\nWhat Mohanty calls “difficult epistemic and ethical negotiations” will occupy my attention in the rest of this essay. For it is precisely through these negotiations that the essentialist identity/credibility formulation may be resemanticized not to establish difference as an autonomous category of knowledge but to comprehend this relationship between identity and competence as self-knowledge that is a priori and asymmetrically constituted by difference.\nThe personal and intellectual discomforts I describe in the following ",
