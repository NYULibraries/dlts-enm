            "pageText": "culture” in that the “use, consumption, and circulation of their sexualized bodies underwrite the organization and the reproduction of the social order, in which they have never taken part as ‘subjects.’”69 These oppositions between user and tool, subject and object privilege an implicitly masculine human culture and subjectivity that achieve their integrity and mastery through a symbolic abstraction from physical embodiment and the material world (coded feminine). Their privilege is predicated on and against this supposed infrastructure or medium, a move that reduces the material processes and the feminine to “sameness,” to an “originary ground” that is mere medium without meaning. It is against this masculinist, liberal humanist ideal that the work rethinks and revalues a monstrous, embodied, feminine writing realized in relation to digital hypertext writing practices, and questions the former consignment of embodiment and the feminine to a backdrop against which the masculine, instrumental subject and his meaning emerge.\nIn her counterhistory of communication technologies, Zeros + Ones: Digital Women + the New Technoculture, Plant explains the particular relevance of digital media to such feminist critiques. Aligning digital networks such as those on which hypertext relies with weaving and textile production, Plant argues that weaving provides a historical precedent and a model for the inextricability of process and product, of the medium and the meaning, of means and ends. In weaving, Plant suggests, “textile images are never imposed on the surface of the cloth: their patterns are always emergent from an active matrix, implicit in a web which makes them immanent to the processes from which they emerge,” thus, “the visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous.”70\nPlant’s comparison of digital hypertext writing to weaving suggests, as do the comparisons Patchwork Girl draws between hypertext and stitching, that the process of navigating digital hypertext and, in particular, of navigating a work of hypertext fiction such as Patchwork Girl, is itself a crucial component of its meaning. Its reading is, to a degree, performative.71 As the patchwork girl informs the reader in “graveyard,” “I am buried here. You can resurrect me, but only piecemeal. If you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together yourself.”72 Reading digital hypertext fiction is similar to weaving and sewing to the extent that the collaboration between user and medium, reader and text, forms an integral part of the work and its inflections. The reader is involved in choosing the sequence of links in such multilinear works, even if, as Marie-Laure Ryan and others underscore, the interactivity in early digital hypertext fiction primarily impacts the narrative",
