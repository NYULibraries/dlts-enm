Will insurance companies and other payors, such as Medicaid, decide not to pay, leaving these drugs only to the wealthy and those in clinical trials?\n• The new regimens have rules that are difficult to follow. Combination therapies require many pills to be taken on a very strict schedule, and some with meals and some between meals. Scientists are concerned that poor adherence to regimens may increase the possibilities of viral mutations, leading to drug-resistant strains of HIV, as occurred with tuberculosis.\n• Will some classes of individuals be automatically excluded because of problems following drug protocols? The author of an op-ed piece in the New York Times has suggested that the risk of creating drug-resistant mutated strains of HIV may justify withholding these drugs from “those who have demonstrated an inability to take medications” (G. Rotello, The risk in a “cure” for AIDS, July 14, 1996, sec. 4, 17). If persons are excluded from available therapies, they are likely to be the powerless and those already oppressed and deprived of too many resources. As one physician said, “If that happens, they have every right to be pissed.”\n• These drugs have side effects. What will be the psychological response of someone who has to stop these medications because of side effects?\n• The long-term effects of these treatments are still unknown.\nSome point out social repercussions: That the new combination treatments may lull society into thinking that HIV/AIDS has been adequately addressed, thus eliminating funding for alternative strategies. As dangerous may be the belief by some HIV-positive persons treated with the new therapies that their HIV has disappeared and they can return to unsafe sexual practices.\nProfessional Practice in the Next Decade\nEach of these issues, and many more, will be in the hearts and on the minds of HIV-affected clients who seek mental health care, including psychotherapy, in the years ahead. The advent of these therapies and the psychosocial and spiritual implications underline the need to be not only compassionate but competent, utilizing the techniques and adapting models ",
