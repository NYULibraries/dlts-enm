            "pageText": "disposed to risk death rather than being an instrument of injustice? Why are his moral integrity, and derivatively his intellectual integrity, so intense? There is no conclusive way of answering these questions. I am not even sure that such questions should be asked; indeed, there is a sort of crass impertinence in raising them. Still, the temptation to speculate is hard to put down. The speculation I offer mixes references to Socrates’ statements and to his psyche.\nOne can say simply that for Socrates, human beings, unlike other creatures, are capable of justice and injustice. That is their distinctiveness. Socrates does not know what full distributive justice is; he does not know humanity or any particular human being, even himself, well enough to know how to confer such justice. He does know what injustice is; he knows what undeserved and deliberately inflicted pain or suffering or dispossession is. He knows what people tend to shun or shy away from. He also knows that those who resent injustice when it is done to them are quite prepared to do it to others, whether initially or in retaliation.\nFrom all this, a possible conclusion is that the truly significant aspect of human distinctiveness is the capacity to do injustice. Socrates’ aim is to curb it: everyone agrees that certain kinds of pain or suffering or harm are bad. The badness is enough reason to curb it. Then add: to persuade people to be less unjust is not to take them closer to human excellence (one component of which would be the ability to confer full distributive justice), but it is to take in hand a distinctive human capacity—the ability to do injustice—and to transform it into a better expression of human distinctiveness, the ability to refrain from injustice. Such a line of reasoning is suggested by what Socrates says in the Apology in regard to the elusive nature of human excellence and the limits on human knowledge concerning it.50 \nOne possible reason that Socrates cares (and that we should care) so much about injustice, then, is that the honor of being distinctively human in the most feasible way is at stake. But I do not believe that in thinking about Socrates, we should put too much weight on the idea of human distinctiveness. We may incorporate too much Plato or Aristotle into the Socrates of the Apology, even if we highlight the negativity of the manner in which he may conceive of human distinctiveness.\n",
