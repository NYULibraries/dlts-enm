            "pageText": "that would mean the use of force to either deliver humanitarian assistance or protect civilians. The UN mandates included enforcing nofly zones, protecting the seven regions that became known as “safe havens,” delivering humanitarian assistance, making Sarajevo free from heavy weapons, and other demands in over one hundred Security Council resolutions over the last four years.26 The United Nations had the authority to enforce these resolutions and protect civilians: it could use “all necessary means.” Yet these mandates were intermittently implemented at best, and, at worst, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and other atrocities were carried out by Serbs in full view of the United Nations without much response.\nHow do we explain such indifference? There are arguably a multitude of explanations, including a lack of will on the part of the member states, Russia’s place on the Security Council and willingness to veto any robust action (because of its alliance with the Serbs), and the Security Council’s failure to allocate the resources and apply the diplomatic muscle required for the job.27 By and large many identify the primacy of state interests as the reason for the United Nations’ refusal to come to the defense of the civilians it was mandated to protect.\nWhile these arguments have some merit, an organizational culture and bureaucratic interests also are present and contribute to indifference. Many journalists covering the war incredulously asked how intelligent, thoughtful, and internationally minded UN officials could articulate, through their actions and occasional statements, the view that ethnic cleansing had to be allowed to continue.28 How could they believe that they could remain morally uncompromised by their position? How were they able to maintain a distant stance, even while recognizing that their actions might implicate them in these atrocities?\nOne explanation is that UN officials insist that peacekeeping is most appropriate and most effective when it operates with the consent of the parties and the United Nations maintains neutrality and impartiality. These principles of peacekeeping generate the stance that enforcement actions are unproductive and are not what the United Nations is about. Although in the first moments after the Cold War the United Nations debated whether it should become involved in peace enforcement and collective security, the opinion of longtime hands was that the United Nations should be wary of this departure from its traditional organizational mission. Although Boutros-Ghali was an early advocate of a more muscular United Nations, he began to rethink this initial position and the wisdom ",
