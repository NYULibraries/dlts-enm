            "pageText": "since his mid-adolescence that Clinton is where he has always wanted to be and can aspire to no higher office and no further time in that office. Clinton’s second term as president, if he gains it, will in a profound way mark the fullest realization of his life-long ambition. What then?\nFor a man who all his life has asked “What else? What else?” the question “What now?” will most likely be very disorienting. However, once this realization has set in, Clinton may feel liberated. No longer forced to struggle to a higher plane or fight for political survival, he will have an opportunity to separate more easily his personal, political, and policy ambitions. Clinton has always emphasized the last and defined it solely in terms of his commitment to the public good. He has bristled at suggestions that the first two played any role. His critics have emphasized the importance of the first two. A second term might provide decisive evidence on this matter.\nYet beyond the question of the relative weight of personal, political and policy ambition, it seems clear that personal and especially political ambition may play a reduced role in a second Clinton term. The constellation of internal forces will have changed. What will Clinton do with the opportunity?\nThe Imposition of Boundaries\nPresident Clinton is a person who has not developed a substantially consolidated set of internal constraints. During his first term his personal psychology was exacerbated by three additional circumstances. First, while his wife tried to help him focus, her purpose was to help him more fully realize their own joint, ambitious agenda. Her attempt at imposing limits or structure on her husband was in the service of breaking through other limits and expanding vast new structures of government action. It is difficult to develop internal boundaries by offering the opportunity to expand external ones.\nSecond, Clinton’s staff essentially exists to serve, not constrain, him. They serve at his pleasure, for his purposes. Therefore, there are severe limits to the degree to which they can compensate for his interior psychology, even if they worry about its effects.\nFinally, and most importantly for the argument I wish to make here, Clinton came into power with his party controlling both houses of Congress. The importance of this fact for Clinton’s psychology is obvious. Not only did Clinton lack a substantial set of internal constraints, but in Congress there was no countervailing center of power.\n",
