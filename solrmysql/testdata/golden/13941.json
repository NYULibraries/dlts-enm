In Western thinking, efficiency is not a moral value. Although it does not have negative connotations, Westerners do not believe that it takes precedence over everything else. Thus, Japanese-style efficiency is not a universal value and the means required to achieve it can even run counter to the values of Western society.\nIronically, the special characteristics that Japanese self-confidently believe are the motivating forces behind the miraculous growth of the Japanese economy are singled out by Westerners as unfair, inhuman, and not universally valid. Japanese, for example, take justifiable pride in the Shinkansen Bullet train because it is safe, comfortable, and always on time.

But, then, Japan’s entire transportation system, right down to the old trains in the remote countryside, generally runs on time. There are few countries in the world where you can literally set your clock by the regularly scheduled trains. The quality of Japan’s train service is certainly something to be proud of, but the downside of this Japanese obsession with punctuality may well lead to such inhuman behavior as that of the teacher at a Hyogo Prefecture high school who in the summer of 1990 automatically shut the school gates at the sound ",
