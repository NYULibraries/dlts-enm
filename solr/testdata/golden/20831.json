When I got back to her, her belly was swollen beneath a red smock and she wore dangerous high-heeled slippers with pointed toes. So we have Flynn. Before long, the sidewalks ended, the houses grew farther apart, and the tended grass began to go. At the last house, I turned a corner and had nothing left to walk on but the dirt road, and no flowers left to see—even if it had been light—but that flowering mimosa tree which will take root anywhere. There was dust up my nose and a band of sweat beneath my hat, and I was afraid I would soon have to be beholden to a colored lady for a glass of water. But then I saw where I was going.\n“A plain house, a dirt-farmer’s house, its paint flaking and leaning to one side. It was all by itself, alone in a great field of nothing but closing-up lilies and Queen Anne’s lace. There was no path to the door. There was no way either in or out of the place I could see. So I just stood there for awhile, beside the ditch running past the flowered field, and thought, does she expect me to fly? No other answer to my problem came to me, no matter how far down I thought on it. So at last I just went on. I went on past the house, straight up the road, getting scared of the dark until finally I happened on the way that was there all the time. It was like trying to find something you want to see in a dark room. If you look directly at it, you can’t see it. You have to look to one side of it, pretend not to be looking for it, then it will leap up against your eyes and you’ll have it to put your hand on if that’s what you want. That’s how I found the way. It was a path that was a tunnel. Big water oaks grew on both sides, met overhead, and made a tunnel. As soon as I was inside, I felt safe and hidden from danger. I could have been a cat out hunting for the night and getting ready to tease a mouse to death. The tunnel curved, then I caught sight of the house again. ",
