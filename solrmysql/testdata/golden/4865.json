            "pageText": "\nin the preceding chapter, the meticulous design of the resort town renders the visit a riveting one. You can therefore take what I have called in the introduction the attitude of a player and just wander around, not so much to find information as to see what type of stores can be found on a street, or what is hanging on the walls in the indoor locations. Of course you cannot as easily go for a ramble in Silent Hill. Many streets are blocked. What is most important is the fact that you feel like you are under surveillance in those streets and places. When impure monsters (and not cops or guards as in action games) are stalking you, possibly waiting at every street corner or behind every door in order to attack you, the stroll is somewhat less nonchalant. The ability to act within and upon the world is certainly one important form of agency, and a great source of pleasure. But as the survival horror genre emphasizes, one gets as much emotion from the power to act upon as from the possibility of being acted upon. Thus the “rush” you get during the fight.\nWith such threats always hanging over you, you better watch your step. As in Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil, Team Silent and their followers are having fun startling you. Following the example of monsters breaking through windows or zombies coming out of closets in Resident Evil, an Insane Patient suddenly jumps out from under a truck at the beginning of SH2, and a Sleeper from under the bed in a room of Onestop in the nightmarish Hilltop Centre of SH3. Followed by a hanging corpse, a piece of metal furniture suddenly falls down noisily from the ceiling right in front of Alex in one of the dark corridors of the Alchemilla Hospital at the beginning of SH: Homecoming. Without a doubt, scripted events are wonderful vehicles for these types of intense automatic emotional responses. In accordance with Robert Baird's analysis, the game designers have the core elements of the film threat scene's startle effect at their disposal:\n(1) a character presence, (2) an implied offscreen threat, and (3) a disturbing intrusion [accentuated by sound bursts] into the character's immediate space. This is the essential formula (character, implied threat, intrusion) one finds repeated hundreds and thousands of times since Lewton's first bus effect [in Jacques Tourneur's Cat People, produced by Val Lewton in 1942]. (2000, 15)\nBaird gives as an example a threat scene in Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979), where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and two of her teammates, thinking the beast hides inside, carefully open a locker, only to be surprised by an\n",
