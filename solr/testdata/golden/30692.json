The Parson already alluded to “soteltes,” but we should note some of the ways cooks played with meat to imitate nature: on lean or fish days, they might disguise one food as another (so that fish takes on the appearance of animal flesh; dried fruits become morsels of meat; other substitutions are used for eggs, butter, cheese, etc.), while on other occasions, a roasted animal was presented in a “lifelike pose.”112 “The wild boar’s head, caught in the act of eating an apple, is of course the prototype of such reanimational or restorative cuisine.”113 Among the other types of edible taxidermy, fowl was sometimes roasted and then redressed in its own feathers, made to look as though it were nearly alive again.114 One such peacock was offered at the coronation feast described in Lydgate’s “Soteltes,” where we also find a boar’s head presented in castellated pastries, a lion mounted on another pastry, and antelopes and leopards etched or sculpted elsewhere.115 Lydgate is participating in a culinary theatrics that has many precedents, particularly when it comes to the way animals are exploited. Sometimes different animal parts were combined to generate hybrids, as in the famed Cockantrice.116 Banquets featured additional anthropomorphized spectacles such as pilgrim capons or the jousting cock, Coqz heaumez.117 The Liber Cure Cocorum describes a sleight by which “somme mete schalle seme raw” and another trick for making fish or meat appear wormy.118 Sweets served at meal’s end could take whimsical animal forms.119 Alongside these ingenious edible confections enjoyed by the wealthy, at least, tables and chairs were festooned with botanical and zoological designs. A grandee’s seat might have animal head moldings or zoomorphic finials. Jugs, cups, and cauldrons offer plenty of other surviving examples: some vessels have claw feet and animal engravings; jugs, which naturally have necks and mouths that perhaps lead to suggestions of animacy, sometimes sport reptilian tail handles; spoons have animal moldings on the terminals. Aquamaniles commonly take the shape of eagles, lions, and horses (see Plate 11).120\n        And yet despite all the composite animal–vegetable–mineral matter around the table, the dangers of mixing were often recognized, not least in proscriptions against behaving in a beastly manner.
