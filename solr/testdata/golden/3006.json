In this way, poetry offers refuge from The Man in all his fascist disguises.\nAll this would seem to make one’s youth the ideal occasion to explore and to appreciate poetry. Timing is crucial here. In short, one must catch kids before they learn to hate poetry. For most, the disease of poetry-loathing, for which there are few dependable cures, onsets in ninth grade, roughly at age fourteen. After that, most students find themselves helpless against high school’s various disaffections, one of which is assiduously to avoid being seen as sensitive and poetically vulnerable before their peers. With great fanfare in 2008, the Academy of American Poets released results of a study indicating the vast majority of poetry lovers came to the art before the age of eighteen. One is tempted to respond to the well-intentioned academy’s conclusion by letting out Homer Simpson’s trademark, “Doh!” Anyone who has worked with young people understands that eighteen is years too late to sample poetry’s ambrosia. It’s generous to say two out of ten college freshmen become poetry converts, so much crucial poetry proselytizing is done not by high-falutin’, university-ensconced poet-professors but by middle school teachers at work among our hormonally wracked youth. It is up to them, and to us in academe, let me repeat with emphasis, to catch kids before they learn to detest poetry.\nFor the most part, that’s not being done. The bulk of students who succumb to poetry-loathing do so before they’re fifteen. Several causes contribute to this unsettling reality. In the classroom, poetry—this innately wild, frequently uncivil, and fundamentally rebellious art—has been neutered. To tame it, classroom poetry, like one’s lovable but unruly pet, has been “fixed.” Many teachers offer their students only poetry-as-eunuch: mannerly, genteel, safe to leave at home alone with spouse and kids. Poetry’s life-creating and life-sustaining vitality has been excised, with resultant pain for verse and for students forced to endure long classroom hours studying its enfeebled blathering. I’m not referring reductively to taking out the sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll but to a larger bowdlerizing of anything that elicits tsk-tsk from the dear gray ladies, whether they be male or female. Put another way, poets and poetry in the schools have been, as Jay Parini suggests, “domesticated.”1 Teachers have left the poetry-wolves in the woods, preferring instead a petting zoo of poetry-poodles, cuddly and well-behaved.\nHere’s an equally thorny problem: Many middle and high school instructors simply don’t hazard teaching poetry.
