            "pageText": "summer of 1953, when Brownell was delaying the decision whether to answer the Court’s request for a second brief, Elman became increasingly anxious about what the Republicans would do, and tensions developed between him and Rankin. Kluger reports:\nTo Elman, the Republicans seemed unsophisticated and sanctimonious. “They’ve been out in the wilderness [so long] … they’ve come to believe their own propaganda,” he confided to Felix Frankfurter. “Rankin, for example, thinks that there is a distinguishing characteristic of the ‘New Deal-Fair Deal’ type of person. Such a person, he told me, believes in the philosophy that the end justifies the means. The Republicans—and this was said with a straight face—do not share that philosophy.”21 \nThe implication is that Elman thought the Republicans did share that “philosophy” and could say otherwise only because they had been out of power for so long. Only naivete or sanctimoniousness could get in the way of affirming the maxim that the end justifies the means. Is this right? Is this a case in which application of that maxim is warranted?\nELMAN’S DEFENSE\nA lawyer’s integrity is bound up with process values. The craft that lawyers exercise and take pride in is not just constrained by but is also informed by their commitment to fair procedures, public deliberation, respect for affected parties, and so on. The constitutional scholar Alexander Bickel—who, coincidentally, was Frankfurter’s clerk in 1952–53—captured this idea when he suggested that the highest morality is almost always the morality of process.22  The New York Times understood this point and rightly took Elman to task for his ex parte conversations with Frankfurter, even though the Times did not fully realize the extent of Elman’s deviance.\nYet as I have indicated, I believe that Elman acted for the best, morally. Although the morality of process is generally most compelling, it is not always so. The good to be achieved in this case was too important for Elman not to take advantage of his unique opportunity to influence the Court’s decision in Brown. At ",
