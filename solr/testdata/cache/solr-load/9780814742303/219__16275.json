The appeals court rejected all of their arguments.14 Here we summarize four appellate issues.\nAttorney Disqualification\nThe appeals court first dealt with the argument that by disqualifying their attorneys of choice, Judge Glasser had violated the defendants’ Sixth Amendment rights to be represented by the counsel of their choice. Following well-settled precedent, the court was of the opinion that\n[t]he accused does not have an absolute right to counsel of her own choosing.… In deciding a motion for disqualification, the district court recognizes a presumption in favor of the accused’s chosen counsel, although this presumption can be overcome by a showing of an actual conflict [of interest] or potentially serious conflict.\nThe court next found that more than the defendant’s rights to a fair trial are at stake in guaranteeing that the defendant’s lawyer does not have a conflict of interest. The court has “an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.”\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Second Circuit panel held that Judge Glasser had not abused his discretion in disqualifying Cutler because Cutler’s acceptance of benefactor payments could have been used as evidence of the existence of the Gambino enterprise. In language highly critical of Cutler’s legal ethics, the court noted that Cutler had functioned as house counsel to the Gambino crime family, having accepted fees from Gotti for the representation of other members of the family, and that this practice raised serious ethical questions.\nAlthough we are cognizant of the right of the accused to obtain representation, we are also conscious of the institutional interest in protecting the integrity of the judicial process. If an attorney will not perform his ethical duty, it is up to the courts to perform it for him. Bruce Cutler had no place representing John Gotti in this case, and the district court properly determined that he should be disqualified.\nAdmissibility of FBI Agent’s Expert Testimony\nThe defendants claimed that they were unfairly and unconstitutionally prejudiced by the testimony of FBI agent Lewis Schiliro, who testified as an expert witness on the nature and function of the organized-crime families. The defense argued that the existence and nature of Cosa Nostra and the Gambino crime family and the alleged crimality of its members were issues ",
