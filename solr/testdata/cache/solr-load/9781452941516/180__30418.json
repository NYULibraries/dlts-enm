            "pageText": "Shin’s translation from the South to the North. In effect, Shin crossed a border between two ideologically opposed, but identically authoritarian developmentalist regimes. The state capitalism of the South, integrated within the world capitalist economy, early on facilitated, indeed demanded, cultural production that was fully articulated with (though continually forced to “match”) Hollywood and the West. The centrally administered economy of the North, robust in its first few decades, was driven into increasing insularity by the continual withdrawal and liberalization of the communist bloc, yielding cultural production that could no longer bear “comparison.” Shin’s hallmark technical rigor and sensitivity to sociopolitical zeitgeists allowed his filmmaking to become the most spectacular, though by no means singular, instance of peninsular border crossing. But further, as we have seen, this traversal is conditioned in less material and more enigmatic ways by the often overlooked codes of pre-Shin North Korean filmmaking. The particular forms of spectacle, affect, and temporality that governed iconic films like Sea of Blood and Flower Girl inhabit Shin’s films in complex and diverse ways. While the episode certainly marks a sensational fracturing in Shin’s life, it also signals continuity within the larger, cosmopolitan scope of Shin’s cinema.\nEnlightenment, Revised\nGiven the eclectic body of work Shin produced over three decades of filmmaking in South Korea, it comes as little surprise that his North Korean films are generically, stylistically, and thematically heterogeneous. As in his work throughout the 1960s, the films he produced under the auspices of the North Korean Shin Films come out of a studio system that aimed at, as was its explicit mandate, films with mass appeal. As sketched above, Shin directed seven films: an early modern historical epic (The Secret Emissary), two films based on colonial period literary works (Salt [Sogŭm]), Record of an Escape), a classic enlightenment film (Breakwater [Pangp’aje]),30 a folktale rendered as musical (Oh My Love), a folktale rendered as fantasy (Simch’ŏng-jŏn), and a folkloric monster film (Pulgasari). Films made under the Shin Films production label include a number of enlightenment films set in the colonial or early liberation periods (A Road [Kil], A Million Li along the Rails, Until We Meet Again [Hae’ŏjyŏ ŏnje kkaji]), war films (Red Wings [Pulgŭn nalgae]), and a hagiographic sports film (Run Chosŏn Run [Tallyŏra Chosŏna]). And before his appearance in Vienna, Shin had also planned out ",
