            "pageText": "American texts emphasize the diversity of peoples in the United States and the diversity of their conditions. Such variation is treated as valuable in and of itself, as well as worthwhile because it portrays challenges and opportunities for individuals in American society. The appreciation of individuality in diverse and difficult situations is a major theme in these texts, Gerbert says. (My reading of some texts confirms this; it would appear from the textbooks that there are no nonhyphenated, white children without handicaps living in intact employed families in America.) Life as presented in these texts is fairly dramatic—important events spur people on to major changes in life; introspection and quiet reflection are rare events. History is presented as full of conflict, and moral evaluations of historical events and movements is overt, as is principled moral evaluation of actions in other stories. Stories about nature either anthropomorphize animals or present humans intervening to conquer or improve nature. Activities associated with the reading texts ask students to develop analytical skills—to understand and evaluate the structure of arguments; to distinguish among fact, fiction, opinion, and fantasy; to discuss hypothetical situations; and to make overt judgments of literary and moral merit.\nIn the Japanese texts nearly all situations presented are familiar, comforting, safe situations. The interior life of the characters in the story, often rather generic narrators, is emphasized more than events in the social or real world in which the characters live. A fifth-grade story about a boy’s birthday talks about his anticipation of the day and his excitement, but the focal event turns out to be his watching a single perfect leaf falling from a tree, an event he observes in solitude. Stories with more distant settings in time and space are most often inspirational biographies.\nA significant number of units deal with a close, empathetic observation and understanding of familiar natural phenomena. Human action seldom intrudes in these observations, and the atmosphere is not one that emphasizes the mystery or awe of Nature, but the intimacy of humans and natural events. There seems to be a preference for observations ",
