            "pageText": "the only area in which courts accept pervasive social stereo-types, either explicitly or implicitly, in ways that diminish the harms suffered by males,41 but it provides an important lens through which one can view the legal construction of gender.\nSexual harassment suits by men (which constitute approximately 10 percent of all such suits)42 often face ridicule. A Minnesota attorney who successfully represented a male city council aide in a sexual harassment suit against a female city council member reported that radio talk show hosts were mocking his client “to the hilt.”43 When eight men sued Jenny Craig International, they complained of both sex discrimination and sexual harassment: that female coworkers had taunted them with demeaning remarks and anatomical comments about their “tight buns,” and that because of their sex they were assigned unfavorable tasks and denied promotions in the predominantly female corporate structure. Columnists derided the suit, sarcastically referring to the workplace isolation suffered by “the Boston eight” as “harrowing,” suggesting that a number of recent sexual harassment claims by men are “guffaw-engendering,” and concluding that while “[i]t is far too late for judges to laugh this stuff out of court . . . that shouldn’t stop the rest of us.”44 Even courts have difficulty seeing female-perpetrator/malevictim sexual harassment as equivalent to the prototypic gender model. In Carter v. Caring for the Homeless of Peekskill, Inc.45 a federal district court in New York held that a male employee had no claim for sexual harassment by the female “chairman” [sic] of the board of directors of his corporate employer, with whom he had a prior sexual relationship, since his “former paramour” had no supervisory power over him, even though she suggested he resign from his position “‘as a personal consideration’ to her.”\nIf men are sexually harassed by other men, they have no legally cognizable injury; if men are sexually harassed by women, they are not believed. The assumptions that the typical perpetrator of sexual harassment is male and the typical victim female are not unwarranted. The vast majority of workplace sexual harassment consists of men harassing women: approximately 90 percent of victims are female.46 Yet this prototype of male perpetrator and female victim may be transformed into a stereotype about sexual harassment that admits no other victim. The incidence of sexual harassment of men may be greater than people believe: of the total number of sexual harassment cases, between 9 and 15 percent are male victims.47\nThe underreporting of sexual harassment by either gender is not surprising. “Sexual subjects are generally sensitive and considered private; women feel embarrassed, demeaned, and intimidated by these incidents.”48 ",
