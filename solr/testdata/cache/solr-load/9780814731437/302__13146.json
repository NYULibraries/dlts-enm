Unfortunately for him, a detailed account of his intemperate speech was published in newspapers throughout the nation, and his appointment was doomed. Although he served briefly under a recess appointment as the second chief justice of the United States, the Senate rejected his nomination in December of 1795.27\nRutledge was, above all else, a gentleman whom Washington trusted. After Rutledge was rejected by the Senate, the president turned to another trusted personal acquaintance—Patrick Henry—but Henry declined. The president wrote that this inability to find a new chief justice was “embarrassing in the extreme,” and perhaps in desperation he nominated William Cushing, who was the Court’s senior associate justice. But Cushing also declined. Finally Washington turned to Oliver Ellsworth as his fourth choice.28\nEllsworth was nominated on March 3, 1796, and confirmed by the Senate the next day. Almost immediately he became embroiled in another facet of the general controversy over the Jay Treaty. As a practical matter, the treaty could not be implemented without money, and opponents seized upon the appropriations process in the House of Representatives as an opportunity to reconsider the treaty’s merits. Ellsworth was keenly aware of these legislative maneuvers, and just a few days before he became chief justice he wrote his wife, “[T]here remains yet to be made one violent effort in the House of Representatives to destroy the Treaty.” He believed, however, “that the effort will be unsuccessful and that the Treaty will be carried into effect, which the honor and interest of this Country very much requires.”29\nOn March 7, 1796, the day before Ellsworth took his oath of office as chief justice, the House demanded that the president turn over all documents relevant to the treaty’s negotiation. Today most justices would remain aloof from this kind of controversy between the executive and legislative branches, but Ellsworth apparently saw no reason for restraint. On March 13, five days after becoming chief justice, he wrote a detailed private advisory opinion on the House’s authority to demand the documents.30\nEllsworth’s opinion is found in a nine-page letter to Connecticut Senator Jonathan Trumbull and clearly was intended to be an advisory opinion. Senator Trumbull had discussed the treaty a few days ",
