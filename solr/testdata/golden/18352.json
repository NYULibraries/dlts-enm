Increased business profits also make possible greater amounts of capital investment and innovation to the benefit of all.\nThe concern is that although the aggregate benefits may outweigh the costs, this scenario raises serious equity problems. The aggregate-benefit-to-all argument may actually be hard to swallow for native workers whose wages are being depressed if they do not have pension plans or personal holdings. Higher-skilled native workers who have such assets are relatively immune from competition. Few lower-skilled workers have pensions or holdings, and are therefore unable to make adjustments or reap benefits from increased profits; the higher-skilled workers (and management) benefit from the higher returns to capital without losing anything at all.\nSTUDYING IMMIGRANTS AND THE LABOR MARKET\nThe array of studies that have examined the labor market effects of immigration can be categorized as regional or sectoral. Regional studies examine the effects of immigrants upon the entire labor market of a particular geographical segment of the country, such as Miami or California. Sectoral studies examine the effects of immigrants upon a single labor market—that related to a particular job sector such as the automobile or restaurant industry. Each perspective has its own advantages and disadvantages, and both are helpful to a better understanding of the way immigrants impact America’s labor market.\nLooking at job displacement and wage issues from a regional perspective causes us to consider the significance of variations in regional economies and demographic characteristics. Jobs are not distributed equally across the country. Nor are immigrants distributed evenly throughout the United States; different immigrant groups have unique histories in different regions of the country. For example, those who are foreign-born make up approximately 22 percent of the total population in California, about 10 percent in the Northeast (16 percent in New York and 13.5 percent in New Jersey), 13 percent in Florida, and about 9 percent in Illinois and Texas. Most of the foreign-born in Florida are Cuban, in Texas Mexican, in California Mexican and Asian, and in New ",
