In 2007, Mr. Blankfein was paid $68 million, a Wall Street record. He did not receive a bonus in 2008.\n \nPromptly at 8 a.m., Bowley checked the wires for results. He saw that The Journal had posted the earnings before The Times. “It's on The Journal!” he shouted, and yelled out the number to Getzfred. Bowley confirmed the numbers independently. After looking at the earnings again, Bowley shouted, “The Journal got it wrong.” He said this in a rushed, almost competitive tone.\nThe two then conferred about whether they were going to make net revenue or net earnings the main focus of the story;6 at this point, Bowley had an income statement printed out with the quarterly earnings. Dan Niemi, the assigning editor, said they should go with the net earnings number of $4.95 billion. “It's more applicable to common shareholders. And say it's above Wall Street expectations,” he reasoned.7 Getzfred and Bowley looked at the hot-button bonus compensation number, and Getzfred said, “This is the lowest [compensation number] ever as a public company.”\nBowley stood over Getzfred's shoulder as they fed the earnings number into Bowley's B matter and uploaded the first version of the story to the content management system and onto the Web. Bowley went back to his desk and refreshed the home page. It took a few minutes for the Goldman story to come up on the business page and then emerge on the lead spot on the home page, though the story was already live on the Financial Times, Reuters, and The Journal.\nBowley worked with Getzfred to tweak the wording in the lead as the two went back and forth with small changes, but the story was up for the public to read. Notably, the story had only been edited by Getzfred: there was no copy editor on this kind of breaking story until after the story had gone up on the Web site. However, for a story to make it into the print edition, it might be copy edited anywhere from two to sometimes seven times before public consumption.8\nBowley's posted story was only the first version of the piece, and he would continue to work on it throughout the day. After posting the basic earnings, Bowley began reading up on the bonus pool from\n",
