Rank followed with his new ideas. These were also formulated in close contact with Freud. On March 20, 1924, Freud could still write to Ferenczi: “My confidence in you and Rank is unconditional.” It would seem that Freud’s renewed interest in the problem of separation anxiety, in Inhibition, Symptoms and Anxiety (1926, 94, 150–52), can best be understood in the context of his dialogue with Rank. Rank replied with a work that is little known today, Fundamentals of a Genetic Psychology (1927—28). Starting from the “psychoanalytic situation,” he develops an interpretation of object loss as being a loss of the milieu (Milieuverlust) (1:28), explores the relation with the mother, and examines the “tendency to go backwards,” that is, regression: “I consider all the child’s affective relations, both positive and negative, as normally being directed towards the mother and I suppose that, later, they are merely transferred to brothers, sisters, and the father (as well as to other people)” (37). Rank treats the entire psychoanalytic situation as a “transferential phenomenon” and declares that “whole chapters of psychoanalytic theory are no more than projections in to the past (and perhaps even into prehistory) of the analytic situation” (38).\nIn my view, it is here that modern post-Freudian psychoanalysis begins to emerge. The dialogue with Freud gave Ferenczi and Rank the impetus to explore the themes of regression and early relationships with the mother centered on the interaction that takes place in the psychoanalytic situation, and resulted in their wondering how a psychoanalytic theory could be developed on the basis of this communication. Even though Freud did not really continue to collaborate in this evolution, and Rank as well as Ferenczi began to assume a certain distance from him, it is undeniable that these are new flowers on the Freudian tree. Despite his preoccupation with issues concerning the father, Freud nevertheless participated in the dialogue with great interest, at least until 1926, that is, until his seventieth year.\nIt was Jones who disseminated the legend that both Ferenczi and Rank ",
