            "pageText": "or controlling ideal bind us together as “black” and make us unique, rather than opposite to white North Americans. Our “blackness,” therefore, is exhibited in various forms of expression encompassing unique and vastly different experiences.\nAll of us—black, white, red, yellow, brown—feel, think, see, and write in order to communicate. But often, the purpose of writing for those who live on the margins has been to keep at bay feelings of impending madness generated by the perpetual contradictions that motivate society. The notion of writer as chronicler, recorder, promulgating the oddities, absurdities, and ironies of human existence and behavior, struggling to coexist with nature and society, is familiar territory. For black women-artists-writers, the struggle to maintain sanity, balancing the mundane with the world of our imaginations, is profoundly challenging.\nLike the characters in Toni Morrison’s Beloved, black women writers often have one foot in this world and one in the next in order to cope with the deafening silence and blinding invisibility suffered under the yoke of colonization. Our sanity and survival have depended on our ability to express artistry through work—in cooking, quilting, tending gardens, and telling stories to our children. What makes one stew tastier, one quilt more comforting, one garden more appealing to the eye, or one story better or more valuable than another is the writer’s innate ability to “story tell.” What one has been through and how one expresses her experience is commonly known as flava (flavor or flair) in our communities.\nWe are people of the Nommo (word), keepers—rather than owners—of the word, whose cultures dictate sharing and passing on, through verbal, visual, or written expression, the knowledge of the circle of life and death. We process our experiences, understand and transmit knowledge through the power of words. Originally the oral tradition was the main form of expression used to accomplish tribal socialization. Our sojourn in America, however, resulted in the repression of our languages and denial of access to the written English ",
