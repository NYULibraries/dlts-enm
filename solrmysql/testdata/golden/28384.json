            "pageText": "Perhaps the most frustrating opposition the anti-genocide activists confront is the obsession of those who want to give “both sides” a platform out of a need to appear “neutral.” Activists are likely to attribute such moral equivocation on the part of their peers to ignorance. “The [knowledge] gap between people who are interested and those who are not is enormous,” says Shin Yasui, a Japanese student and director of the Committee for World Peace at the University of Oregon. An ABC News reporter commented in June 1995 after revealing the results of a new poll, “Few [Americans] are sure what the war in Bosnia is all about.”10\nMany of today’s students go to lengths to give all sides in a conflict an equal hearing. The “default mode,” then, is to not “take sides,” or not to view a conflict as one between a victim and an aggressor until the situation is fully explored. Unfortunately, most students never progress past this default mode by taking time to learn about a situation and develop an educated response. “Everyone is a victim there,” said a freshman biology student polled about Bosnia, who then couldn’t name a single party to the conflict and said she didn’t understand it well.\nWariness of Political Action\nActivists are also frustrated by peers who oppose “political” types of actions. In most cases, students express willingness to attend lectures or support “humanitarian” activities for Bosnia (even though much of the humanitarian aid collected throughout the war was pillaged at Serb roadblocks and prevented from entering by dangerous skies and mined roads). Those students, however, are less likely to be willing to demonstrate or write letters to elected officials with the goal of actually ending the bloodshed. At its extreme, a few students even shy away from engaging in humanitarian aid activities, out of a perception that engaging in them would constitute taking sides. For example, the new student leader of a group that had previously sent tons of needed medical supplies to Bosnia decided to drop the program because it was “too political . . . you’re making a political statement by who you send the supplies to.”\nOn the whole, there is enormous pressure on the student groups to be more humanitarian aid-oriented than “political.” Humanitarian activities are met with wider approval, provide opportunities for raising funds, and are more likely to be covered as “human interest” stories in the media.
