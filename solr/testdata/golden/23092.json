In chapter 5, I argued that underlying his turn toward people was an element of strategic empathy, a method of being in touch with others for the purpose of advancing his own goals. Ultimately, I suggested, this reflected a lack of trust in people.\nMany, including Clinton, have attributed his friendly and other-directed style of interpersonal relations to growing up in an alcoholic family. But Clinton’s turn toward others began much earlier and for wholly different reasons.\nRoger Clinton married Virginia Kelley in 1950, when Bill Clinton was almost four. According to Kelley, problems with her husband’s drinking did not become pronounced until well after they had moved to Hot Springs in 1953, at which time Clinton was seven. Yet apparently Clinton had begun to exhibit this turn toward others well before then, as early as kindergarten in Hope. One of his early childhood friends in Hope, Donna Taylor, recalled that Bill would “light up” when he was around other children and that “some people like to be with other children. Billy was like that. He was always right there. Almost obnoxious. He was at the center of everything” (Maraniss 1995, 32).2 Another childhood friend from Hope recalls that in kindergarten Bill “wanted to be everyone’s friend. It would upset him if someone in any group that he went into didn’t seem to like him. It would trouble him so much that he seemed to be asking himself, ‘What do I have to do to make this person like me?’” (Wright 1993, 28).\nIf the effects of his stepfather’s alcoholism didn’t begin to manifest themselves on any regular basis until well after the behavior described above took place, they can hardly be the cause. Clinton’s turn toward others is better explained, I believe, by the loss of his biological father and the loss of his mother when she went to New Orleans for two years to study.\nClinton, of course, did not realize at first that he didn’t have a father, but it must have become clear soon enough when he started to play with other children. Also critical here was the fact that his mother left him for two years. His traumatic memory of their infrequent visits suggests that her absence was an important early experience for Bill. Recall, too, that a child who loses a parent often longs for him or her and can become “object hungry” (Neubauer 1989, 68)—that is, they search for persons able to provide what is missed in not having the absent parent (in this case parents). Clinton’s growing realization that he didn’t have a father coupled with his mother’s absence was a powerful inducement for Clinton to seek out other people.3\nOne other factor crucial to understanding Clinton as a person and a ",
