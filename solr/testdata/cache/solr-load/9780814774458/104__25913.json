            "pageText": "these three quotes from lesbians who do not believe that bisexuality exists as a legitimate form of sexuality:\nI feel that bisexuals are very confused people, and will probably become lesbians. It’s just that they are still on phase one. (Monifa) (African-American)\nI feel people who think they are bisexual are confused about it, or in transition. (Isabelle) (Euro-American)\nUsually it means a transition or a confusing part of life. It really doesn’t exist. (Kamala) (Indian-American)\nThere are also no apparent differences between the definitions of bisexuality used by lesbians of Color and White lesbians, nor in the ways different racial groups conceptualize sexuality.1 Approximately equal percentages of lesbians in each racial group define bisexuality in terms of behavior, approximately equal percentages define bisexuality in terms of feelings of attraction, and the majority of every racial group conceptualizes sexuality dichotomously.\nComparisons between the images of bisexuality and feelings about bisexual women held by lesbians of different racial groups gave mixed results. For example, on average, African-American lesbians believe more strongly than White and Indian-American lesbians that bisexuals are really closeted lesbians, but there are no racial differences in the belief that bisexuality is a transitional stage that some women go through before they come out as lesbians. On the other hand, African-American lesbians and Indian-American lesbians believe more strongly than White lesbians that bisexuals lack commitment and that they are more likely than lesbians to want to pass as heterosexual, but there are no racial differences in lesbians’ assessments of bisexuals’ trustworthiness or of the relative ease with which bisexuals could pass compared to lesbians. Findings about racial differences in lesbians’ willingness to associate socially and politically with bisexual women are equally mixed. None of the differences between African-American, Indian-American, and Euro-American lesbians are statistically significant, and it is very possible that they reflect random variations in individuals’ beliefs rather than true racial differences. To impute great importance to these findings or to try to use them to argue that there are racial differences in lesbians’ attitudes about bisexuality would be to overstate them, and perhaps to engage in racial stereotyping.\n",
