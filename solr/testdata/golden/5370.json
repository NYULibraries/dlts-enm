It suggests how these emergent technics might help to reconceive distinct modes of material agency, their microagencies, and the intersubjectivities they co-realize. It illustrates how digital hypertext and digital writing technologies that have emerged since can shed new light on these enactive relations, on the processes of embodied action that link material bodies, perception, sensorimotor action, and cognition to larger lifeworlds in specific, recurring, dynamic, differential ways.\nIn Patchwork Girl, these enactive relations are, I’d suggest, envisioned as tactics of the human through which the specific, intersecting differentiations that consolidate the legible sex, gender, and race of human subjectivity and their possibilities for intersubjectivity are sedimented and rerealized over time. Understood as tactics of the human, these relations can be seen to establish highly contingent, yet recurring experiential and materially-realized parameters through which the recognizably human emerges. Tactics are, in Michel de Certeau’s sense, everyday practices, “ways of operating,” or doing things that entail a strategic borrowing from that which one has selective access to, but, by definition, cannot own or control, in this case, the unrealizable, “proper” place of the human.106 One is unable to pick or choose these relations and the modalities of the human they open onto as they are already structured through recurring discursive and material relays and embedded in experience; “the place of a tactic belongs to the other.”107 Instead, these relations are the very means through which the boundaries of the human become perceptible and are registered. Nonetheless, the enactive relations joining the human with technics are multistable, open to degrees of manipulation and play and, thus, open to tactical engagement, to reorientations and “makeshift creativity.”108 Engagements with emergent digital writing technologies, such as Patchwork Girl, underscore multiple, long-standing, sedimenting and transformative tactics through which the human is co-produced without ever attaining full ownership of the terms of this ongoing coproduction.109\nPatchwork Girl’s attention to the enactive relations through which the human emerges, its engagement with the monstrosity that informs all tactics of the human and renders them subject to change, is radical when read in relation to liberal humanism’s instrumental understanding of the human—as absolutely, timelessly, and categorically distinct from his technological prostheses, from material lifeworlds, and from nonhuman animals. Yet it is increasingly clear that in the context of corporate technoscience and late capitalism’s practices of “flexible accumulation,” simply acknowledging the negotiability of the human and adopting a posthumanist understanding of ",
