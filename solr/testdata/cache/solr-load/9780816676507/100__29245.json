            "pageText": "participant observation research with the Berets, detailed the community’s medical needs: “Despite the presence of the County–USC Medical Center and several public health clinics, East Los Angeles has been one of the areas of the county with the greatest incidence of tuberculosis and infant mortality. The Mexican-American population of Los Angeles has a lower life expectancy than the average for the county. Even Medi-Cal has made only a small dent in the medical care problem.”83 Fox’s findings on the inability of poverty health programs to close health care gaps echoed those of planners for the War on Poverty’s neighborhood health centers.\nSecuring funding, finding a suitable location, working in a community-professional coalition, and obtaining supplies and equipment were common difficulties in opening any new clinic. One week before opening day, the Brown Berets encountered an equally common problem for political clinics–the police raided their headquarters. They took lists of contributors and professionals who had committed to donating their time, a clear attempt to intimidate potential supporters of the clinic, and on opening day, a plainclothes police officer observed the occasion.84\nThe opening was a significant accomplishment. The organizers would go on to help San Diego activists establish their own clinic in Barrio Logan.85 Historian Dionne Espinoza describes how the LA clinic fit within the broader strategies of community control on the part of the New Left and revolutionary nationalists, noting that their clinic “put into practice the Berets’ goal of control of institutions, and was a labor of love for the Berets as well as for the professionals and community members who supported it. Adorned with posters promoting cultural pride, self-determination, and la familia de la raza, it was a comfortable and inviting space for its bilingual and Spanish-speaking patients.”86 (While the Brown Berets shared a colonial critique of the racial oppression they faced in the United States, the leadership [though not all party members] was antagonistic to Marxism and Leninism.)87 Some reporters, though, were skeptical, and contended that the clinic represented, as Fox put it, “some malevolent design by the Berets.”88 But to the women members of the Brown Berets who were so central to the clinic’s establishment and operations, police repression was the malevolent force that threatened to undermine the clinic.89\nThe harassment the Brown Berets endured would be repeated at other clinics in Los Angeles and across the country. It was not uncommon for free, political, and women’s clinics to experience police provocation and loss of leases. This was especially true in the case of clinics established by ",
