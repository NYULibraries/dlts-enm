This is also evident in his openness to information and argument during the process. The level of give-and-take that characterizes these meetings is evident, even if the progression of the argument is not always systematic or sequential.\nComplex judgment frameworks usually involve the integration of one or more frameworks into which the problem might productively fit. It is now clear, for example, that a more complex framework for judgment and analysis during the Cuban missile crisis would have been one that included U.S.-Cuba (large power-small state) relationships. Had the executive committee members had that model in their minds, they might have been better able to answer the question “Why would the Soviet Union put missiles in Cuba?” and perhaps had the basis for a settlement of the crisis, a “no-invasion pledge.”8\nDo complex judgment frameworks require an equally complex mind? The ability to hold and synthesize alternative frameworks is partially a reflection of cognitive capacity. Some leaders are able to integrate and hold more information, demonstrating what Suedfeld (1992) has termed cognitive complexity. However, it is not clear that cognitive complexity is necessary for high-quality decisions, an issue that Tetlock (1984) raises.\nComplex thinking does not necessarily lead to better policy judgment. Obsessive thinkers, for example, usually exhibit highly complex and differentiated thinking. However, such individuals do not as a rule have good judgment. While their thinking may be complex, it often lacks depth, flexibility, and sophistication. It is the latter three qualities, not the first, that help to define the quality of judgment.\nWhat is crucial to good judgment is understanding, not complexity per se. The amount of reflective insight that a president brings to bear on a problem may prove more important than the degree of complexity in his thinking. Reflective insight is only partially and indirectly related to cognitive complexity.\nIs good judgment situational? I argue that some basic characterological elements stand at the core of good judgment, which would seem to be an argument in favor of a general characteristic of good (or poor) judgment in presidents and leaders. While this is accurate to some degree, good judgment is also closely connected to particular domains, problems, and the frameworks that have been generated by experience. A president’s (or ",
