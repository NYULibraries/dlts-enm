The question that has been posed for nearly a century is whether mandated leave legislation following the birth of a child will help or hinder women’s position in society. This argument, like the economic one just discussed, has largely ignored the needs and interests of the young child. Instead, it presumes that the woman rather than the fetus or young child is receiving the special treatment.\nPROTECTING THE CHILD AFTER BIRTH\nEqual Treatment Cases. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act has generally been interpreted to incorporate an equal treatment rather than a special treatment model. In doing so, the act sometimes helps prevent overt discrimination against pregnant women but never helps accommodate the needs of the child following birth. A case that reflects this pattern is Maganuco v. Leyden Community High School District 21232 Plaintiff Maganuco was a pregnant schoolteacher who wanted to use her accumulated paid sick leave before taking an unpaid maternity leave. But school policy forbid someone who took maternity leave to combine it with paid sick leave. Maganuco argued that this rule violated the PDA by creating a disparate impact against women in the workplace. Drawing a distinction between the plaintiff’s medical needs and her child care needs, the court ruled against the plaintiff:\nTeachers who choose not to take maternity leave, and decide instead to return to teaching as soon as their period of pregnancy-related disability ends, are unaffected by the policy that Maganuco challenges. The impact of the leave policy that Maganuco contests, then, is dependent not on the biological fact that pregnancy and childbirth cause some period of disability, but on a Leyden schoolteacher’s choice to forego ",
