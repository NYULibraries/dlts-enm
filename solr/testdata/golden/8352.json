Mature character consolidation also reflects having satisfactorily resolved sometimes conflicting needs and their resulting dilemmas: interpersonal connectedness versus personal autonomy, approval versus independence, and self-interest versus a concern for others. While poor judgment can result from a failure to respond adequately to threat, it can also occur when a president realizes the risks but because of overconfidence is not deterred. Unbridled ambition and rage (Renshon 1993 a) are two other characterological sources of poor judgment. Last, mature character involves having a developed and consolidated personal identity (including ideals and values) that provides the president not only a vehicle for the expression of himself in the world but also an internal compass for the evaluation of policy dilemmas.\nCharacter consolidation reflects relative success in another crucial developmental and functional taskâ€”that of making and developing a range of interpersonal relationships. Being able to make emotional connections to others reflects a number of important psychological accomplishments, including a capacity to go beyond self-interest, and provides direct emotional and cognitive experience of the concerns and feelings that others have. This experience is crucial to empathetic understanding, a fundamental element of political empathy and, as I will argue, good policy judgment as well.\nPsychological Elements of Good Judgment\nWhile good judgment is to some degree contextually specific, poor judgment tends to be systematic. Good judgment, as noted, is related to the qualities of both analysis and reflection. This distinction underscores the point that good judgment is only partially cognitive.\nThe model of presidential judgment developed here distinguishes among analysts, reflection, and enactment. Analysis refers to the capacity to discern the essential nature of problems, the potential avenues of response and their implications, and the method(s) by which responses might be accomplished. Of course, this requires the ability to comprehend and process information, as well as to compare information elements with one another and with other frames of reference. These are ordinarily considered cognitive skills, and to some extent they are. However, they are substantially affected by character.\nReflection refers to the capacity to consider and evaluate analytical ",
