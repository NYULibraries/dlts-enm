In most educators’ appeals to equality, we privilege equality of opportunity over equitable outcomes, processes over results, colorblindness over race consciousness, and individual freedoms over group experiences. Furthermore, as Derrick Bell reminds us in his analysis of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, “The danger with our commitment to the principle of racial equality is that it leads us to confuse tactics with principles. The principle of gaining equal educational opportunity for Black children was and is right. But our difficulties came when we viewed racial balance and busing as the only means of achieving that goal. At a much earlier point than we did, we should have recognized that our tactic was making it harder rather than easier to reach our goal” (Bell 2004, 189). In a similar way, most educators’ commitment to restrictive formal equality shapes our daily policies, practices, and discourses and thus limits the pursuit of expansive substantive equality.\n      This distinction between restrictive formal equality and expansive substantive equality builds on my discussion of equity in the introductory chapter. The restrictive formal equality talked about here is what is typically understood as simply “equality.” And expansive substantive equality is very similar to what I’ve been calling equity—or, in other words, that which is fair and just (Brayboy, Castagno, and Maughan 2007). That which is fair is typically not the same as that which is equal. Genuinely pursuing equity often requires unequal distributions of resources in order to address long-standing and persistent inequalities. Returning to Bell’s point about the Brown case, when we confuse tactics with principles, we also confuse equity and equality. If our ultimate goal is equity, we cannot continue to emphasize simple equality.\n      Equality is both ahistorical and acontextual, and as such, it is unable to address inequity. An ahistorical and acontextual understanding of student achievement, for example, fails to account for the ways in which achievement was initially measured through racist exams and normed against particular groups. It also fails to recognize the importance of the differential access youth have to good schools, high-quality teachers, appropriate and challenging texts, and culturally relevant education. The ahistorical and acontextual nature of equality is highlighted in Gloria Ladson-Billings’s distinction between “achievement gaps” and “the educational debt” (Ladson-Billings 2006). Thinking solely about a current gap in achievement between different racialized groups is very different from thinking about the multiple historical, economic, health, political, and ",
