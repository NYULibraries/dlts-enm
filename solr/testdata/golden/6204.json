Also see Accardo, Arata (Fictions), Jann, Kestner, Rothfield, or Thomas.\n2. Belsey and Jann both argue that Conan Doyle's women characters present an obstacle to Holmes's logic and rationality, since they do not always behave in predictable ways. My argument pertains to women's visibility and image, but since scientific rationality depends on objective observation, my claims are in some ways congruent with theirs.\n3. See, for example, Christ and Jordan, Armstrong (Fiction), or Meisel.\n4. My analysis focuses on the short stories that appeared in the first three collections, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, and The Return of Sherlock Holmes, all of which were published in the Strand from 1891 to 1904. (Some of the stories from The Return also appeared in the U.S. magazine Collier's.) I occasionally make reference to the earlier Sherlock Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of Four (1890).\n5. The two early novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four, were initially published with few illustrations, and did not sell well. After the huge success of the Strand stories, the novels were reissued with rich illustration.\n6. Other such publications included Ludgate Monthly (1891–1901), Pearson's Magazine (1896–1939), Harmsworth's Magazine (1898–1933), and the Royal Magazine (1898–1939).\n7. For more on Victorian magazine culture and publishing, see Brake, Law, or Fraser, Green, and Johnston.\n8. The Illustrated London News and Punch employed heavily illustrated layouts from mid-century, but not in the context of telling stories.\n9. As Wakeman describes, in the mid-1880s, wood block printing was effectively made obsolete by a range of new photomechanical technologies in visual reproduction.\n10. According to Orel, “a Holmes story by itself could raise … circulation by more than 100,000 copies” (5).\n11. See Popple for more on the x-ray as a form of popular amusement in Britain. See Crary's Suspensions and Techniques for more on nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century visual innovation.\n12. Benjamin claims photography “is no less significant for criminology than the invention of the printing press is for literature,” and notes detective fiction's debt to it: “The detective story came into being when this most decisive of all conquests of a person's incognito had been accomplished” (Charles 48). Gunning writes that photography “provides the ultimate means of tying identity to a specific and unique body. In this way the process of criminal identification represents a new aspect of the disciplining of the body which typifies modernity” (“Tracing” 20).\n13. “Golden Pince-Nez” also has a female killer, but the murder turns out to have been accidental.\n14. See Leps for more on this topic: “If the theoretical ambitions of [Holmes's system] are vast, its actual state of elaboration leads to the identification of individuals as representative types—results homologous to those of criminology” (194).\n15.
