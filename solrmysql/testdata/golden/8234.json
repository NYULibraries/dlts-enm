            "pageText": " FOURIs the Psychological Impairment of Presidents Still a Relevant Concern?\nHow much concern should we have regarding psychological impairment of our political leaders? Kearns (1976, 317—18) has argued that\nno matter how well a polity’s institutions are designed, its leaders are subject to lapses from rational functional behavior. Every society learns to live with a certain amount of irrational behavior at the top, but lest the irrationality feed upon itself and lead to general decay, the polity must have the capacity to marshal forces that influence or compel the faltering actors to revert to the behavior that is required if the polity is to function properly.\nA study group of psychiatrists, convened by the American Psychiatric Association, who examined the problem noted that “examples of VIPs who have remained or have been retained in office despite gross impairment can be drawn from government, the military, the judiciary, industry, the church—in fact from every area of public life” (GAP 1973, 33). Moreover, they note, “History is replete with examples of mentally impaired VIPs” (GAP 1973, 22). The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP) study mentions and presents brief case summaries of VIPs who have experienced substantial psychological impairment at some point in their public lives because of physical factors, emotional factors, or some combination of the two. Included in their list are King George III of England, Ludwig II of Bavaria, Paul von Hindenburg, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Benito Mussolini, Earl K. Long, and James Forrestal.\n",
