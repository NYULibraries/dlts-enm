Their declared indifference to philosophy and “theory as such” is no longer to be consoled by theory-hope.6 They remain inconsolable to the point of abandoning pragmatism itself—thus hoping to bring it back to where it began, to the vision of the new, yet still unapproachable America. Back to the old pragmatism’s vision of “making our future different from our past,” as Richard Rorty keeps underlining the difference in question, in the name of solidarity instead of objectivity, democracy instead of philosophy, or fairness as justice.7\nIt is here that pragmatism meets deconstruction, although for reasons other than neopragmatists seem able to see. It is not deconstruction’s antiessentialist, antifoundationalist side effect, let alone a new “kind of writing” that would account for this meeting.8 Rather, it seems to be pragmatism’s insistence on the impossible difference traditional philosophy kept promising without ever being able to deliver; to go, for example, for fairness, while justice may seem as yet, and maybe forever, unapproachable. The crucial place of A Theory of Justice for any pragmatist attempt toward making a difference, is also deconstruction’s topos for investigating the force of law and maintaining the difference in which legal regulations fall short with respect to the justice approached.9 Justice may be nothing but the name for this difference between legal practice and the law’s force, which both carries on this practice and, in carrying it out, transgresses what is carried out with respect to the justice to be done. Likewise fairness may be the best possible name for this imperative to transgress, rather than toward prosecution, enforcement, and execution. Justice may be, and may have to remain forever, out of reach, but nonetheless approachable—if and only insofar as fairness is, indeed, applied. How, if not pragmatically, with respect to a given situation, and given the time, can justice be assessed? No instance is better suited to exemplify the paradoxes of pragmatism than justice in America.\nBut more than just this remains to be said for the exemplary role of justice in the American “drama of consent.”10 After the first ",
