            "pageText": "become. All the knowledge acquired about dreams serves also to put the dream-constructing process on its guard” (1958c, 95).\nIn a surprising conclusion to this remarkably brief paper—it runs a scant six pages—Freud warns against instructing patients to write down their dreams upon awakening as a ploy to prevent their repression. It will only hamper their ability to associate about the dream later and, in any case, wouldn’t this encourage an obsessiveness about remembering something that should be allowed to occur spontaneously? Resistance to analysis often intervenes in the guise of sincere effort. “Homework” of any kind may be detrimental, because psychoanalysis is committed to the act of spontaneity and the seemingly accidental surprises that erupt when least expected. If a concluding piece of advice could be constructed to encapsulate the essential theme of this dense essay, Freud couldn’t have said it better than when he notes: “I know that it is asking a great deal, not only of the patient but also of the doctor, to expect them to give up their conscious purposive aims during the treatment, and to abandon themselves to a guidance which, in spite of everything, still seems to us ‘accidental’” (94).\nBefore we close, there is one footnote that should be added. It concerns the technique of dream interpretation and Freud’s remarkable suggestion that unusually skilled interpreters needn’t use it. This refers to the laborious—Freud calls it “tedious”—process of inviting patients to list their associations to the dream components before interpreting the dream in its entirety. Many analysts today have dispensed with this complicated form of interpretation altogether and simply share with their patients spontaneous renderings of the dream’s apparent meaning. Some analysts argue that this short-cut flies in the face of “correct” analytic technique. But Freud himself advises this measure, once the analyst feels sufficiently experienced to do so. Only “beginners in psychoanalytic practice, at any rate, are advised not to take this exceptional case as a model” (95).\nThis last piece of advice shows how relaxed Freud soon became in matters of technique. It’s telling that this paper, the first in the series, puts so much emphasis on the analysts’ discretion rather than the elusive “correctness” of their behavior. This, in turn, sets the tone for the papers that follow. Rather than instructing analysts what to do, tact and discretion in all matters is advised.\n\n\n",
