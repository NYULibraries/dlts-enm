Five or six of them returned with us to Israel.\nThe cats were with us for two and a half years, and in some way, they made us feel as if we were out of jail. You pet such a delicate creature, and you forget where you are. They gave us a sense of warmth, of release. At night they used to lie in our beds, warming our legs in the winter. All day we played rough games with them, which helped take some of our aggression out. Our hands would be all scratched from these “battles,” and then we’d pet them, and it would be all over.\nWe had parrots as well, but I didn’t care for them. We had a young kite in the yard, which was wounded and couldn’t fly yet. One day a sergeant came in and smashed its head with a brick. He wanted to test the Jews, see their reactions. All these Egyptians were standing there and staring at us. They could have taken the kite away, if it was forbidden to raise it, but why did they have to kill it right before our eyes?\n\n",
