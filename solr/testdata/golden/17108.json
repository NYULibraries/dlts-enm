Even Cromwell, despite his Independent orientation, suggested that toleration should not be “stretched so far as to countenance those who denie the divinity of our Saviour.”94\nIn fact, though, a small number of financially successful Marranos had begun filtering into England during the 1630s and 1640s (Marranos were Spanish Jews who at least formally had converted to Christianity). Since as a matter of practical politics Cromwell sought to promote English commerce, he was inclined to allow these Marranos to remain. The issue finally came to a head in 1656. In late 1655, England had gone to war against Spain. The Spanish Marranos thus were faced with a dilemma: either stand accused of being enemy aliens (as Spaniards) or admit to being Jews. They chose the latter, and in March 1656 they once again petitioned Cromwell. At this point, the government refused to lift the ban against Jews but nonetheless officially allowed the Marranos to remain in England as Jews. This small community of Jews continued to expand throughout the Restoration and even more so after the Glorious Revolution, as William and Mary reestablished Anglicanism but with a degree of politically inspired religious toleration. Even so, English Jews most often were treated contemptuously and were subject to legal persecution. To a great extent, then, the fate of Jews in England mirrored that of Jews in other European countries. As the various Christian sects found themselves unable to crush their opponents, a limited amount of religious toleration for different Christian groups became politically necessary. Then, when other political circumstances proved propitious, Jews managed to share in this toleration, becoming incidental beneficiaries of these Christian stalemates.95\nENGLISH POLITICAL THEORY\nIn terms of the future development of the separation of church and state, one of the most significant consequences of the English political metamorphosis was the emergence of modern political theory, particularly the writings of Thomas Hobbes, James Harrington, and John Locke.96 Hobbes wrote most of his works during the Civil War period of the interregnum, with his most famous book, Leviathan, being published in 1651. The political and religious chaos of this period largely determined Hobbes’s objectives. Leviathan—which, in Hobbes’s words, was “occasioned by the disorders of the present time”97—appeared only two years after the regicide and before the adoption of any new official governmental structure. Thus, to Hobbes (and many of his contemporaries), the overriding concern was how to reestablish civil peace, order, and security. To some extent, then, ",
