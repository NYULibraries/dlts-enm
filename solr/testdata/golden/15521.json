The poem “Emilia Plater” was especially propagated in the school curriculum during the Communist period despite the anti-Russian content. Since the collapse of communism and the onset of the family-oriented Catholic nationalist campaign, its imagery is largely absent from public discourse, which has been taken over by the Polish Mother ethos.\nBozena Choluj,30 who significantly ignores the existence of the other myth of a cross-dressing woman-hero (as it is absent from the post-Communist nationalist discourse), explains instead that, in today’s Poland the equation of Heavenly and Polish Mother continues as a model of double service for women to follow. This double service entails service to her family and, through the family, to Poland. Fulfilling this double service guarantees the woman a “double satisfaction” which she can obtain within the “domestic” sphere to which the Heavenly Servant-Mother of God destined her.

The Polish nation (narod) and personified Poland (Polska) were both conceived as holy. Because the nation was a democracy (of the nobles) and somehow free from sin (like the Virgin), it became a threat to the increasingly evil and tyrannical neighboring states. So the evil rulers of the neighboring states decided to murder both Poland and Freedom. The satanic trinity of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, with France playing the role of Pilate, completed its conspiracy: the Polish nation, like Christ, was crucified, but:\nThe Polish nation did not die: its body lies in the grave, but its soul has descended from the earth, that is, the public life, to the abyss, that is, to the domestic life of ",
