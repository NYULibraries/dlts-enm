Instead, these tactics of reorientation register the fact that contemporary modes of power are largely immanent to these digital technics and materially realized, networked social spaces. For this reason, these political methods are, themselves, devised to be immanent to the very socio-spatial practices they intend to reorient. These tactics, therefore, involve using these very emergent, late capitalist socio-spatial networks and other hegemonic social spaces to remap these same system processes and open onto other possibilities, however open-ended, short-lived, or aggregative their political acts may be. Similarly to more recent tactical media practices, such as the influential Occupy movements with their diverse coalitions only identified as the 99 percent, these tactical reorientations of material spaces serve to make the social, cultural, and epistemological agenda of the 1 percent tangible and visible. The Internet-based Occupy movements’ momentary reclamation of public, material spaces serves to make apparent the resources and political power that has been stolen from the diverse, unnamed 99 percent, making the exclusion of the bulk of the U.S. population from the full benefits of this social space literal and tangible at these site-specific encampments. While the lack of a concrete, shared political program is often the basis for sustained critique of these political methods, it is worth reconsidering what the nonidentity of the 99 percent and the open-endedness of their platform, similarly to other recent tactical media practices, reveal about the nonoppositional workings of power in late capitalist, U.S. social spaces and what this suggests about political methods well-suited to this terrain. The nonidentity of the 99 percent significantly transformed the discourse and, likely, the results of the 2013 U.S. presidential election, while the encampments, long since relinquished to city officials and the ordinances they designed to prohibit such public gatherings, now appear to have been equally symbolic, yet no less forceful reverse “occupations.”\nThe novel’s diagnosis of late capitalist modalities and topographies of power anticipates these more recent tactical media practices: their immanence to the hegemonic code/spaces they intend to materially and symbolically reorient; the nonoppositional “table-turning” of spatially sedimented power they instigate; and the momentary, open-ended character of their political methods. The novel ends, for instance, before the results of the ",
