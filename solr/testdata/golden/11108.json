            "pageText": "increasing reputation of Hungarian psychoanalysts is marked by the fact that five of Hermann’s followers who received their training after World War II (Hidas, Linczényi, Nemes, Paneth, and I) were admitted to the International Psychoanalytic Association at the 1975 London Congress. The Hungarian psychoanalytic movement has developed further ever since and made efforts to overcome the disadvantages of its protracted isolation. In 1989 the renewed Hungarian Psychoanalytic Society became an accredited member of the International Psychoanalytic Association. But this is another story.\nNOTES\n1. On Fülöp Stein and his relationship to Jung, see Hermann (1974a).\n2. Hermann’s memorial lecture (1974b) was read in 1974 at the meeting held in memory of Ferenczi.\nREFERENCES\nBálint, M. 1937.
