            "pageText": "HIV-affected persons have convinced providers that rigid frames of practice do not adequately serve clients. The inadequacy has several causes, including these:\n\n\n— Much current practice is based on Western European models, that is, white majority-culture models, of providing psychotherapy. These models are foreign to and perhaps inappropriate for minority-culture clients and fail to meet their needs.\n— Current psychotherapeutic models fail to account for the diverse and complex needs of medically involved patients.\n\n\nThis author emphasizes the need to be therapeutically flexible (Winiarski, 1991, 1993) and to use a style of practice called “bending the frame” (explained further in chapter 2).\nWhile much is said about culturally sensitive or culturally competent practice, in fact it is so complicated that mental health practitioners largely ignore its implementation. Practitioners must realize that acceptance of, or sensitivity to, a client’s culture is insufficient; they need to be well versed in the culture, to understand it, and to accept its role in the client’s life. The therapist must create a therapeutic relationship and make interventions that are culturally consonant for the client. Obviously, cultural competence requires a great deal of study and experience.\n• The model provides a metamodel under which many disciplines can interact.\nMany contributors to this book practice as part of interdisciplinary teams. They realize that just being around the same table doesn’t make for a team. Full teamwork—what many of us call integrated care—comes when people talk with each other and regard each other with respect. But, often, teamwork is hindered by a lack of a common way of thinking.\nBecause practitioners in this country all speak English, we fail to recognize that disciplines have different professional cultures and that these differences create some of the greatest barriers to integrated patient care. Physicians, nurses, psychologists, and social workers generally emerge from training with different worldviews, including etiological presumptions, treatment strategies, and decision-making styles. Even within specific disciplines, persons have different assumptions. A person who provides cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, for example, likely has different ",
