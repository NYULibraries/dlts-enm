These slaves, of course, were not even counted as whole persons for that purpose. The move toward multiracial categories in the late nineteenth century with the highly ambiguous categories of mulattos, quadroons, and octoroons was described as an “heroic attempt” to “prevent racially mixed individuals from crossing the racial line into the White population.” 17 This enumeration reflected an attempt to keep tabs on the degree of racial mixing as part of an anti-miscegenation political effort.18 (This data was also collected from visual identification, not self-identification.)
