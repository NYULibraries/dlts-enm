But the risk that intervention will make things worse rather than better is far too crude a reason for an across-the-board prohibition on interference with voluntary agreements. In some circumstances, interference may produce significant benefits and may have minimal costs. But it is time to explore the problem in more particular settings.\nII. DISRUPTING AGREEMENTS: A CATALOGUE\nThe purpose of this section is to catalogue, with some particularity, a set of arguments for disrupting voluntary transactions. In the cases to be discussed, considerations of justice argue against rather than in favor of market ordering. Many of the examples might also be thought to involve harm to others; for present purposes, however, that possibility will be put to one side, and the cases will be explored as if others were unaffected. Moreover, I need not, for present purposes, make a choice between arguments from welfare and arguments from autonomy. Even competitors to those arguments—stressing virtue or certain forms of community—fit congenially with the various suggestions put forth below. The basic goal is to set out a range of reasons for disrupting voluntary transactions, even if such transactions deserve prima facie respect.\nCollective action problems and the prisoners’ dilemma. It is a familiar point that voluntary transactions that are individually rational will sometimes produce collective irrationality. A conventional example involves the decision whether to pollute the environment. In individual cases, pollution may be entirely reasonable in light of the subjective costs and subjective benefits, but collective action—in the form of legal proscriptions or private organization—may increase social welfare. Government intervention may be necessary to disrupt voluntary agreements when there is some such problem. Many areas of legal regulation may be thus understood. This ground for disruption of voluntary transactions is of course well established in both theory and practice, and it is not necessary to dwell on it in detail here.2\n",
