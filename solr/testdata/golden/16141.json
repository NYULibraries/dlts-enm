Further, the prosecution showed a surveillance video of Indelicato being congratulated at the Gambino family headquarters, the Ravenite Social Club, by Bonanno family consigliere Stefano Canone and Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce less than half an hour after the murders. The government offered this after-the-fact approval to show that the commission had authorized Indelicato to kill Galante.\nThe Defense Case\nThe scope and depth of the prosecution case confronted the defendants with a difficult task.

The defendants argued that the contractors were willing participants in an extremely profitable cartel and should themselves have been prosecuted for bid rigging. According to Anthony Cardinale, the lawyer for Anthony Salerno,\nIt is a club of contractors, not of commission members … the commission had nothing to do with the concrete payments.… Listen to the words that are actually being spoken, they do not contain any threats or any pressure.… The concrete companies gladly paid to gain an advantage in the industry.11\nFurther, the defendants argued that there was a long tradition of bid rigging in New York’s construction industry, predating the alleged influence of a ",
