Peg Boyle Single's Demystifying Dissertation Writing is billed as a “streamlined process from choice of topic to final text” and boasts a glossy image of a lightbulb turning into a laptop morphing into a book, suggesting that a finished project is the inevitable outcome of following her steps to success.11 While the steps are many, vary depending on scholar and topic, and require consistent commitment, following such a regimen is portrayed as a surefire way to achieve results. Boot camps, one of the newest arrivals on the scene, suggest that laziness is all that stands in the way of a completed dissertation. They invoke a drill sergeant's approach, promising to turn “slackers into scholars.”12 As Barbara Ehrenreich has pointed out in her critique of the “bright-siding” of American culture, the ever-growing “business of motivation,” which imparts its advice with annoying sunniness, naively presupposes that dutiful work unconditionally leads to success.13\nSecond, the literature all but overlooked much of what made our partnership uniquely successful: our online relationship. This is in part due to the rapid pace of innovation in our digital age. Bolker's 1998 volume contains an appendix titled “How the Computer Revolution Affects You and Your Dissertation” and almost quaintly enumerates the “disadvantages of the computer,” seriously contemplating the possibility that a dissertator might write her manuscript in longhand.14 Authors writing more recently point out the benefits and pitfalls of a computer for organization and procrastination, respectively: the ability to file and reference notes and drafts is unparalleled, although so are the possibilities for spending hours in the universe of online media, music, and messaging. Single's book comes closest to the type of strategy we devised, as she briefly mentions that the “real-time” experience of trading instant messages with a writing partner improves accountability. But as a group, none of these writing guides consider that a one-on-one online relationship could be crucial to motivating a struggling dissertator to sit down each day to write and, ultimately, to complete a dissertation.15\nFinally, we cannot help but think that the literature suffers from the\n",
