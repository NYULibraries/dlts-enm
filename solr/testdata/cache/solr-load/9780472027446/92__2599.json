            "pageText": "\nIn an English 310 exercise, I number my students off into groups of three, then have them decide which two will play incarcerated youth and who will be the new earnest student facilitator from English 310 who comes to work with them. I send the facilitators from the room and tell the incarcerated youth to make everything extremely difficult for the facilitator. What happens is sometimes even agonizing to watch: the facilitator faces inattention, chaos, individual acting out or closing down, youth storming out, and hard hard challenges and questions. Afterward we debrief. One year, Jessica Anthony, who had played a Maxey youth, told us she had kept pushing the facilitator because she so much needed him to be the right person, to say the right things, to be the person she, from an abusive, negligent background, needed more than anything. And he hadn't been able to give her what she wanted, he wasn't ready, attuned, authentic. He couldn't focus on her, his words were nice, conventional. I'm sure he also desperately wanted her to understand who he was, what brought him there, his needs, his wishes for the relation, what was authentic in him.\nWhat I am missing when I seek the workshop may be different from what Chris seeks or Shar or Wilson-Bey or Ricardo. But all of us have been cut off from each other. All of us have been malnourished. All of us are full of experience, talent, and history and are rich, problematic personalities, but we have all been deprived by the walls which have been built between us. At some inarticulate or not well articulated level we want connection between us, and community. What is so exciting about the workshops is that this is in the air, in our process. What is so exciting is that the creative tasks challenge us to find within ourselves what we have to give to ourselves and others and that something happens in the room when we succeed. Whether we know it or not, the workshops are charged with this possibility. Most of the time we probably fail—none of us get the words right—but it is in the air, and when it fares, for a moment or completely, we find what we are seeking. That it has been in the air is evidenced in the frequent refrain among us when a workshop ends, that “we have been a family.”\nOften as a workshop ends—especially in the juvenile facilities where we are not allowed to have contact afterward—my students are upset that they will not see their workshop members again, and the workshop members are aware, we're all aware, that the walls are still there, that mostly—not always—our lives will continue on separate tracks. Yet those for whom the experience has been profound will seek each other in other people. Once someone has been respected, one seeks respect. Once someone has broken\n",
