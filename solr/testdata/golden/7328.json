            "pageText": "Later in this chapter, we will explain young libertarians’ sometimes fraught relationship with electoral politics, particularly the practice of voting, and how that relates to their philosophical outlook on social change, their belief in a broad repertoire of political action, and their investment in several different levers of change (Zuckerman 2013a) with which to influence institutions and agents of power. This de-emphasis on electoral politics also calls into question changing notions of citizenship, and we describe a few different models of alternative citizenship (Bennett 2008b; Boler 2008; Dalton 2009) wherein young libertarians, who often downplay the importance of national citizenship and emphasize a broader global citizenship, might fit.\nThe Liberty Movement\nThe majority of the people interviewed for this study considered themselves part of the Liberty Movement or, as younger members dubbed it, the Student Liberty Movement. As described earlier, the Liberty Movement, which is largely youth driven, includes those involved in “Big L” or electoral-based libertarian politics and “little l” libertarians (who we see as largely adopting the “second-wave” model described above), who seek to effect social change through educational and discursive mechanisms.\nThe Liberty Movement is a broad one in concept, potentially encompassing anyone interested in furthering the causes of individual and economic liberty regardless of political affiliation. Students for Liberty is the organization at the center of this case study, with most (though not all) participants having some affiliation with it. Students involved with SFL are often self-identified libertarians, though the organization as a whole maintains the broader mission of “advancing liberty,” a concept most often used to describe protecting individual freedoms but which can stand in for a wide array of causes. The SFL website (2012) sets forth the organization’s commitment to and understanding of liberty:\nStudents for Liberty is an organization that supports liberty. SFL does not dictate the foundations upon which individuals justify their belief in liberty. Rather, Students for Liberty embraces the diversity of justifications ",
