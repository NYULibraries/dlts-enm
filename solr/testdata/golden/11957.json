We failed to persuade them to leave us. They reside here and even behave as if they intend to remain with us. Is it possible to expel their spirit, which controls the press and the financial network?132\nWe have to set up a concentration camp in Hajmasker in order to save ourselves from whatever damage we can still be saved from. To isolate them completely we have to construct a defensive wall around the concentration camp. But that is not enough! We will have to construct a defensive wall around Hungarian land, around Hungarian spiritual life, and around Hungarian power sources. We will have to be constantly awake in supervising these walls, so as to defend those values important for our race: Only by means of putting these additional steps into operation will there be real value to the isolation of the Jews in the concentration camp.133\nYet another editorial dealt with the interpretation and appreciation of a certain speech delivered by Bishop Prohaszka:\nIt will be most desirable and even important for the Hungarian Christian public opinion to devote suitable attention to the words uttered by the great, most admired bishop of Szekesfehervar, Ottokar Prohaszka … Many are they who delude themselves into thinking that after the fall of Jewish imperialism, known as Bolshevism, they may rest on their laurel wreaths. Yet behold, the great apostle of the Hungarian Christian public has arisen to warn us loudly and publicly: “Our homeland is in danger!”\nThe clear voice of the great bishop warns us of the danger of terrible destruction threatening with a moral revolution everything that the two-thousand-year-old Christian culture and the thousand-year-old Hungarian culture have succeeded in introducing into the souls of the people and their moral understanding. The obstinate evil spirit, with its cruel logic, attacks Jesus of Nazareth again and again. That same evil spirit is unwilling to accept the fact that it was defeated on the hill of Golgotha. It is consistent in its dedication to its wild materialism, in its worship of capitalistic Satan.\nOnly that powerful democracy that rests on the union of all Hungarian Christians, only a merger of all those who believe in Jesus of Nazareth, will be able to save our souls and our future. The oriental phantom, this dark, threatening shadow which follows us around like a shadow following its body, will invoke upon your head a curse of fire and brimstone if you walk in the ways of God and if you lift up your eyes unto the ",
