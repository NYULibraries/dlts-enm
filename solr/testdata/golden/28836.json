This is not unlike Lilia Bartolome’s (1994) argument that the persistent “methods fetish” among teachers solely concerned with finding the “right” teaching strategies misses the importance of the ways power and dominance are reproduced in schools, the deficit view held by many educators about students of color, and the institutional oppression that affects students’ performance in school.\n      Some multicultural education scholars promote multicultural education as “good education” (see, for example, Banks 2001; Nieto 2004) in order to make it more legitimate and palatable to teachers in a range of school settings. While this makes sense in theory, teachers often take up the language of multicultural education to describe what they do even though they do not subscribe to the meaning of multicultural education that most leading scholars have articulated. In other words, teachers have co-opted2 the name multicultural education to describe what they have always done. This, then, illustrates an important concern in packaging transformative educational strategies as “just good education.” Whiteness encourages the co-opting of potentially disrupting philosophies and practices in order to maintain inequity. This reframing of potentially dangerous concepts is also consistent with niceness because of the way it obscures structural dominance behind individually focused issues.\n      Human Relations\n      The second way teachers in the Zion School District understood multicultural education as powerblind sameness was through a commitment to improving human relations skills. Most teachers believed that improved human relations were both the goal of multicultural education and the actual effect of engaging multicultural education. Teachers at both Spruce and Birch talked about how they believed multicultural education would expand their students’ worldviews and therefore lead them to be more respectful and accepting of diversity.\n      Spruce teachers talked about the goals of multicultural education as exposing people to the “interesting” and “diverse and rich” cultures that are in Utah, expanding students’ understandings of the world, and teaching students that everyone has a culture that is deserving of appreciation. These teachers also believed that multicultural education affects students by encouraging them to get along and treat each other better, creating ",
