            "pageText": "Spoken by a “universal genius” who was “essentially a great musician” but whose talents also included painting and journalism, Kurtz’s words characteristically combine the power of vision with the immediacy of sound, synaesthetically, to overburden subjectivity with a sense of “presence.” We are asked, for example, to “see” Kurtz’s speech as a “stream of light,” and to “hear” in Marlow’s last “image” of Kurtz the “faint ring of incomprehensible words” (i 59). Conjuring the wonders of vision through the ringing tonality of verbal eloquence, Kurtz articulates the illusion of “real presence,” and commands a rhetorical energy essential to both the artist and the politician. This power to unveil the “seen” through language echoes Conrad’s own desires, as stated in the preface to The Nigger of the “Narcissus”:\nAll art . . . appeals primarily to the senses ... to the plasticity of sculpture, to the colour of painting, and to the magic suggestiveness of music. My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel—it is, before all, to make you see.24\nKurtz clearly epitomizes a power to which Conrad himself aspires. But this power to unveil the “seen” frequently eludes Marlow. One can detect a hint of Conrad’s own anxiety in Marlow’s exclamation: “Do you see him [Kurtz]? Do you see the story?” (82). Marlow’s restless self-doubt ends on a pessimistic note: “It is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one’s existence. We live as we dream—alone” (80).\nAt a later stage of the narration, however (exactly where Marlow begins to gain power over Kurtz by speech), the solipsistic analogy of the dream is abandoned. Through the “terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares” (144), Marlow “talks” Kurtz into “seeing” things his way and persuades him to return to the boat. Marlow’s control of dreamlike words suggests that the “dream” speech is not as powerless as he had thought, and further, that the “dream images” of speech are not as solipsistic as they seem. Indeed, the magical, rhetorical “real presence” of Kurtz’s speech seems inextricably bound to the seductive and narcissistic power of the dream.\nKurtz’s Rhetorical Power\nDream imagery bespeaks desire as it also betrays an inner poverty of need. “The elaboration of the dream,” Lacan comments, “is nourished ",
