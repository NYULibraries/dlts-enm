            "pageText": "In order to determine if a person has an honest and reasonable belief that her life is in danger, one must, to some extent, look into the mind of the defendant and the social conditions surrounding the crime. In the hypothetical case of a person shooting a homeless man, the defendant could introduce as evidence of her honest belief the fact that on two previous occasions she had been attacked by homeless people and therefore was afraid when confronted by a dangerous-looking street person. The defendant could also introduce evidence regarding the reasonableness of her fear. She could show that many assaults had recently taken place on that street; that women, in particular, had been victims; and that some of the attacks had come with no warning whatsoever. Without more evidence, a jury would be almost sure to reject her argument that her shooting a homeless man walking toward her was a reasonable act of self-defense. What is important for our discussion is that the beliefs of the defendant and the social context of the crime are allowed into evidence.\nThis chapter focuses on two 1925 cases in which the realities of racial prejudice and housing segregation were thrust into the courtroom by Clarence Darrow as part of a self-defense strategy. By the time Darrow defended Dr. Ossian Sweet in 1925, he had spent years forcing the American legal system to confront class and race issues, as well as advocating for religious liberty and abolition of the death penalty. Darrow’s fifty-five years of legal practice included some of the most controversial cases in history. Although there are many talented lawyers in American history, and many lawyers whose cases gave them national notoriety, Darrow’s reputation has been the most enduring.\nThe admiration and fame Darrow still enjoys are a testament to that strain of the American democratic tradition which finds compassion for the underdog and respects those who stand up for the rights of others. It is fascinating, in a society which has always condemned crime, that the most positive symbol of a lawyer is not a corporate attorney, not a prosecutor, not an attorney general, but a criminal defense lawyer. I suggest that part of the explanation for this lies in the people’s abiding belief in the right of every person to defend her liberty. Even in times such as today, when law-and-order hysteria sweeps through the nation, defense lawyers can take heart from Darrow’s legend and know that when they raise a black rage defense, they too are attempting to tap into that compassion, ",
