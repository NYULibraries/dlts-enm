            "pageText": "ground the perceived need for innovation clashes with the power of authenticity embedded in Jewish tradition. Finally, although feminists are prominent within the full spectrum of Jewish institutional life, for the most part the proponents of radical change in Judaism remain outside the central organizations of American Jewry. Indeed, they have introduced many of their liturgical innovations in small, often separatist women’s communities; as yet, these innovations have not had much impact within the larger Jewish community.\nNo analysis of the impact of Jewish feminism, as well as its prospects for the future, would be complete without consideration of the resistance to change within the American Jewish community. The reluctance of some congregations to hire women rabbis, particularly as senior rabbis in large congregations or in the more prestigious pulpits, bespeaks a deep ambivalence about women in positions of authority. For some American Jews it is easier to accept women as cantors than as rabbis, because cantors are seen as subordinate religious functionaries. I have heard colleagues speak with horror about the “feminization” of the rabbinate and its consequent decline in status, even though women now comprise at least a third of students in such prestigious fields as law and medicine. Although women have entered Jewish communal service in large numbers, they continue to be clustered in the lower ranks and in middle management. Only a tiny percentage have attained the position of executive director of federations.21\nMost disturbingly, many communal spokesmen continue to posit an inherent conflict between feminism and Jewish survival. From the middle of the nineteenth century, Jewish leaders have held women, especially mothers, responsible for defections from Judaism and the Jewish community, even though radical assimilation was far more common among males than females.22 That tendency to project onto women communal guilt regarding assimilation continues, though in a muted form, when Jewish communal spokesmen attribute to women virtually sole responsibility for Jewish survival and criticize them alone for seeking self-fulfillment at the expense of Jewish communal goals.\nThe feminist task that confronts American Jewry as it prepares for the twenty-first century is less obvious than was the challenge ",
