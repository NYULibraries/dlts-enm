Those messages have come from parents, teachers, peers, literature, television, radio, and movies. They have come also from institutions that establish sports programs, school activities, and employment opportunities. Even those parents who believe strongly in gender equity may feel compelled to socialize their children toward traditional gender norms to avoid seeing their children branded as social misfits.114\nParents may subtly perpetuate gender norms in ways they do not consciously recognize. Adolescent and family research demonstrates that fathers and mothers treat teenage boys differently than they do teenage girls. They encourage adolescent boys to work outside the home at an earlier age than adolescent girls. Parents assign household chores so that boys are not encouraged to do domestic chores, while girls are assigned housekeeping duties: “Girls do the dishes, boys do the lawn.”115 Later in life, girls act out the domestic chores they have been taught, while boys make little effort to overcome their learned helplessness in the domestic arena.116\nFamily behaviors regarding chores, benefits, and rules relating to independence (such as curfews and car usage) reflect significant gender biases. Parents transmit the idea that boys need cars more than girls and more supplemental income because they should take girls on dates or provide for their own economic well-being by working independently outside the home. Adolescent males are governed by more permissive rules regarding curfews and use of the family car.117 Parental responses inculcate and reinforce gender-specific sex role behavior.\nA study of gender norms among high school students covering the late 1970s to the late 1980s indicated that boys acquired prestige principally through sports, grades, intelligence, and access to cars, while girls did so through their physical appearance, sociability, grades, and intelligence.118 One interesting finding of the study was that in the latter part of the 1980s, girls attained more prestige, in the perceptions of boys, through participation in sports.\n",
