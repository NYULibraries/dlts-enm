The case study about John and Susan at the beginning of the chapter demonstrates a few of the barriers.\n\n• One barrier is a sense of unfairness. John and Susan had already been faced with one illness and had managed that one, and they had taken other measures to avoid pregnancy—a vasectomy—and figured that they wouldn’t have to deal with birth control (i.e., condoms) again. For others, the problem is that they still wish to have children, and their goals for safety and pregnancy conflict; actually, in the first years of safer-sex recommendations, the birth rate among people with hemophilia increased. These issues involve losses and resentments that, unresolved, stand in the way of making healthy behavioral choices and changes.\n• John and Susan had never used condoms before, having relied on birth control pills and the diaphragm, as did most of their contemporaries, so condom use presented a further barrier, the need to learn a new behavior. Their negative feelings about condoms and their failure to keep them always available stood in the way of using them all the time. It is often the case that use of alcohol or drugs reduces the likelihood of condom use, too.\n• At first, John’s doctor was reluctant to have him tested for HIV, because he felt that it would upset him beyond his coping abilities and because there was no treatment to offer. Years later, this reluctance is less common, but many HIV-infected people say that they began to practice safer sex consistently only after receiving their test results. Thus, any barrier to testing—attitudes, fears, stigma, or practical matters of cost, access, or confidentiality—has the potential to impede safer sex.\n• Lack of accurate information, or misinformation, represents another barrier to secondary prevention. John and Susan had both been given inaccurate information from lay and professional people, ",
