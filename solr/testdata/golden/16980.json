Once again, informational and incentive concerns come to the fore. If we imposed substantial taxes on inheritances people would have a strong incentive to buy annuities (after all, it is the absence of the wide use of annuities that would be expected for life-cycle reasons that forms a major part of the rationale for a bequest motive) and to invest in their children’s human capital. If we wish to minimize inherited wealth and maintain savings, we will have to rely on monetary and fiscal policy to generate the savings.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY\nIt is of course a platitude to say that we are now part of an increasingly integrated world economy. This realization has had a profound impact on work in economics, so that many widely held beliefs about monetary and fiscal policy as well as about the relation of domestic savings and investment have had to be reformulated. Here I will examine a few of the issues that it poses for our understanding of the relation of markets and justice.\nOne would expect that any theory of consequential justice would argue for a radical redistribution of income between the inhabitants of rich and poor countries. Whatever may be said about the degree of inequality in any one country, the variance for the world as a whole is much greater and, one would think, the demands of justice greater. Historically, a major source of the demand for economic justice was not so much inequality as the fact that people were living in extreme poverty. In the developed world we are much richer now, so that our poverty level is well above the average income in the rest of the world, much of which does live in extreme want. As Tullock puts it in commenting on Rawls, “If you actually do not know who you are, and you think therefore the likelihood of your being a ",
