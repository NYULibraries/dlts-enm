He can be, as the Russians say, stupid to the point of saintliness (“glup do sviatosti”).33\nThe Fool and His Mother\nJoanna Hubbs prefers to view the fool’s altruistic behavior as “motherly.”34 A quite explicit example is the foolish general who sits naked on some eggs in order to hatch out the chicks—a hen is a mother, after all.35 In an early Soviet literary variant titled “Van’ka Dobroi” (“Van’ka the Good) the fool lives happily ever after with his mother and two of the animals he has saved.36\nThe Russian folkloric fool tends to be strongly attached to his family, especially his mother. Altruism in Russia, as everywhere else,37 is learned on mother’s knee. But the foolishness as well as the altruism should be characterized as “motherly,” or at least as having to do with the mother. In many variants the problem is that the fool cannot seem to make a break with his mother. He is often the youngest child, which means he is the last one to have emerged from his mother’s body, and no one else has since occupied his position as mother’s little boy.38 He is very passive and dependent on his mother. His closeness to her is part of what makes him laughable. He is an adult, but is developmentally retarded. Sometimes he is speechless, like an infant. He is a lazybones, a stay-at-home, usually remaining in his mother’s hut and lying on (or behind) the stove. Sometimes even his name suggests the stove to which he is so attached: “Ivan Zapechnik” (“Ivan Behind-the-Stove”) or “Kniaz’ Pechurinskii” (“Prince Stovish”).39 The image of the stove (“pech’,” a feminine noun) is decidedly maternal, and reinforces the idea of the fool’s continuing dependence on his mother (“The stove is our dear mother,” says a peasant proverb).40 Like a little child, the fool is often without britches, he is dirty,41 does not clean himself, has a runny nose, and so forth. His mother is more or less forced to take care of him.42 When he does get up the energy to go out and do some daring, stupid deed, he often follows this with a return home to his mother and a reversion to his former passivity and nearly symbiotic union with his mother. The behavior of the Russian folkloric fool thus exemplifies that grade of masochism in which the individual, when behaving masochistically, is attempting to move away from the mother (see clinical discussion, ",
