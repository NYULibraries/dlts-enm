Moreover, to his surprise he had discovered that he derived great satisfaction from his duties as a congregational rabbi. He enjoyed presenting sermons and lectures to his congregants—tasks at which he became very proficient, having hired a voice teacher to help him refine his oral delivery—meeting their pastoral needs, and even being active in the day-to-day affairs of the synagogue management; for example, he was very involved in the architectural design of the new sanctuary.\nDisaffected from the Orthodox rabbinical community, Agus officially broke with the RCA in 1946—1947 and joined the Conservative movement’s Rabbinical Assembly. In this new context, by virtue of his rabbinical erudition, his Orthodox smicha, and the force of his personality, he became a powerful presence and an agent of change.

He was, in turn, appointed to this committee (and to others) and remained a member of it for nearly forty years, until his death.\nOne of the earliest and best examples of his view on how the halakah should be interpreted is reflected in the important “Responsum on the Sabbath” that was issued by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards in 1950. This responsum stated that the use of electricity was permitted on the Sabbath and that riding to and from the synagogue on the Sabbath was also permitted. The first decision was arrived at by use of the traditional halakic process, with one major exception, and the second was justified as a takkanah (a rabbinic enactment) responding to ",
