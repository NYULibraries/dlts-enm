            "pageText": "In short, we need to analyze how the president’s style fits in relation to his overall psychological and behavioral patterns. Is a president’s relational style motivated by the hope of being accepted, admired, respected? Does the view of the president as particularly smart and well informed help define his personal and political identity? Is his persistence driven by the need to be validated? Does the president’s style flow from developed and consolidated characterological elements, or does it operate primarily to compensate for what he does not have or cannot count on getting?\nConsider interpersonal relations, which are clearly so central to Clinton’s political style. It is important to know how skilled he is, but also how he uses those skills. Lyndon Johnson is often credited with being a masterful president in this regard. His skills at cajoling, manipulating, flattering and, where necessary, threatening are legendary. James David Barber calls this the famous “Johnson Treatment” (see also Evans and Novak 1966, 95–117) and argues that Johnson “exemplifies, as no other president in history, an emphasis on personal relations” (1992, 67).\nDoris Kearns (1976, 371–72) writes that Johnson\nobligated his followers by providing them with services or benefits that they desired or needed. But the line between obligation and coercion was often thin. In return for his gifts, Johnson demanded a high measure of gratitude, which could only be acceptably demonstrated by the willingness to follow his lead…. These demands for submission invariably worked against him.\nThere can be no doubt that Johnson had strong interpersonal political skills. But these skills were in the service of an even stronger psychological need, that of getting his own way at whatever cost. The very array of information he possessed about the strengths and weaknesses of others and the range of his approaches to them reflect that Johnson had a specialized and well-developed skill. But this is not the whole story. Johnson could be demanding, forceful, and, more than occasionally, personally abusive to those who balked at his wishes. The intensity and frequency with which these tactics surfaced suggest that the skills were in the service of a very strong psychological motivation to get his way, in many cases at the expense of others’ self-esteem.\nSuch behavior and the psychology behind it, however, will not always appear in such a stark guise. A “narcissistic character” might well ultimately be interested in exploiting people for his own ends but might nonetheless have developed gracious social skills to do so. There are very ",
