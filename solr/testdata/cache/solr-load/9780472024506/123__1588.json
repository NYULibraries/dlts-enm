In a similar vein the Sydney Games of 2000 provided a stage on which Australia could present a new multicultural image and, in its opening and closing ceremonies, pay tribute to the heritage of its indigenous people (Waitt 1999).\nThe prospect of being an Olympic host tempts every emerging power sooner or later, and it did not take long for China to catch the Olympic bug. At the start of their very first Games since the Cultural Revolution, the Los Angeles Games in 1984, the People's Republic of China called a press conference and announced its intent to host the Games in 2000, thereby beginning the chain of events that would lead to Beijing 2008 (Miller 1984).

The Nazi regime made some concessions to world opinion by removing many anti-Semitic posters and playing down the increasing military presence in German life, but the Games had drawn attention to negative aspects of life in the Third Reich.7\nPolitics swirled around the Games of the Cold War, and the Melbourne event was especially badly hit. China stayed away to protest the participation of Taiwan; Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq stayed away because of the Anglo-French invasion of Suez; while the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain boycotted the Games to protest the Soviet invasion of Hungary.\nFrom the early 1960s and for thirty years thereafter the issue of the participation of South Africa rubbed raw, prompting boycotts by many African nations. Boycotts were threatened to keep Rhodesia out of Munich and—unsuccessfully—to exclude New Zealand from Montreal (a punishment for a rugby tour of South Africa). The tit-for-tat boycotts of\n",
