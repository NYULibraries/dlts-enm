Friendship is perhaps an imported sentiment for which most Frenchmen have little taste. Inclined to material or abstract pleasures, they have no room left for this extravagance. And perhaps even a Celt like Remy de Gourmont24 would never have experienced the singularity of such a feeling if he had not discovered the use of his most secret yearnings. Devastated in his flesh, in revolt against God, having resisted all belief, he finally found in friendship—that worship of intimacy—a compromise between love and religion.\nAs for the letters born of this friendship with continual services: they were often the reply to some question raised in our talks and which he would go off and develop at leisure in his solitude.
