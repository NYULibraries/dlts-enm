All of these assignments will be familiar to anyone who teaches historical methods. It is instead what happens in the second half of the course that is unusual, generative, and that turns out to be a bit controversial.\nAfter the seventh week of the semester my students began building their own historical hoax, a hoax they eventually launched into the digital world with great pride and satisfaction, not to mention a fair amount of glee. Using a consensus model, I asked everyone to come up with ideas for a possible hoax, and as a class they winnowed the choices down to two finalists. The students developed the standards for what the hoax should be, including that it would have to be historical, that it would have to be plausible to fool people who encountered it, that there would be a sufficient evidentiary basis for that plausibility, and that there would be a “hoaxable community” out there (i.e., a community of people liable to buy into the hoax because it appealed to them for personal or professional reasons). The first time I taught the course, to their surprise (and mine) the hoaxable community turned out to be one the students did not expect—academic historians and educational technologists. The second time I taught the course, the students were less successful as hoaxers, but their attempts generated much more media and public interest.27\nThe hoax the first class finally settled on—The Last American Pirate—was organized around the senior research project of a fictitious student the class named Jane Browning (a name chosen because it was so common), who uncovered her Virginia pirate quite by accident. This man, Edward Owens, was a Confederate veteran who, during the Long Depression that began in 1873, found that he could no longer support his family by oyster fishing and so turned briefly to a life of sea-borne crime. He and his crew of two robbed pleasure boaters in the Lower Chesapeake until the economy recovered, at which point Owens went back to fishing and clean living. He left behind a legend and, as luck would have it, a last will and testament detailing both his exploits and his guilt over what he had done. There really was a man named Edward Owens who lived along the Lower Chesapeake at the time, and my students chose his name for two reasons—he really did exist, and they could find no evidence that any of the millions of genealogists out there knew anything about the real Edward Owens.28 Also, the name Edward Owens was generic enough that a Google search would ",
