Most, though not all, advocates of natural law or moral realist jurisprudence make a similar move, claiming that hard cases should be decided by appeal to these transcendent standards. Although many nonetheless insist that constitutionality and goodness are distinct, as Barber and Walker do in the quotations cited earlier, it is exceedingly rare for them to argue that a particular decision is unconstitutional but good, or even constitutional but bad.\n19.

Kent Greenawalt and others have suggested that, as Dworkin believes, conformity to precedents should also count as part of the test of fit because the Constitution is a set of ongoing understandings, not just the original text, and because constitutionalist values of stability and predictability are served by honoring stare decisis. I think that counting precedents as part of the meaning of the Constitution defines the Constitution too much in terms of what courts have said, not what the people’s elected representatives have ratified, in contradiction to the Constitution’s professed source of authority. I agree that conformity to precedent often serves values that constitutionalism aims to realize, but so does much legislation to which we would not accord constitutional status. I therefore think that we should count conformity to precedent as a factor ",
