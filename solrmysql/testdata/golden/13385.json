Out. Outside. The great outdoors. Gone.”\nHe mulled this over. He said, “I don’t think so.”\n“Bye-bye,” she told him.\nHolgate stared at her. She was all broken machinery—one minute fine, the next everything jumping from her face, or so fallen in she could hardly move.\n“Look,” she said after a pause of several beats, “okay?—I am the other adult here.” Sunlight behind and spilling over, the day pinched and quiet before him.
