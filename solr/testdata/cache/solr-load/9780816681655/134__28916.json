And we’ve met with [the high school] faculty three times and shared with them the reading growth with our low kids, and we showed them where they start and where they end. And they, ah, they can’t help but like us after that because they are realizing, you know, we’re not being lazy over here. We are actually moving the kids, but we’re just getting a third of our kids reading on a third-grade level or lower. OK, so . . . we’ve shared with the [high school] faculty that we’re looking for those AP numbers to go up. So we are giving them gentle but firm pressure. We’d like to see those numbers go up, and we are asking them for feedback on what our kids don’t know that they need to know so that we can be training them to be able to take advantage of the cool things and life-changing things that they could be a part of at [the high school]. So it’s not adversarial but it’s tough. I mean, we’re sending a clear message.\n      \n      Mr. More identifies a step-by-step process in which he engaged to begin to break down the systemic inequity impacting his students. He first recognized that the system is broken: He wondered about the “college-level readers” from Birch and the missing “bridges” to ensure Birch students succeed at every point along the educational pipeline. He continued working to change the broken system, and he did so through multiple points of entry and strategies. He talked to educators, educational leaders, counselors, and parents, and he was armed with clear and convincing data. He also named specific structural pieces that were broken when he pointed to the number of students in AP courses and the lack of information provided to parents. Mr. More recognized that this work is not a one-shot effort; instead, it requires constant reminders, soliciting feedback, and sharing potentially uncomfortable information with various institutional actors. And finally, he pressed for change in the outcomes—noting that his work was “not adversarial, but it’s tough.”\n      These efforts are especially important given the context of Birch and the Zion School District. All Birch students attend the same high school unless they move out of the school’s boundaries or complete a bureaucratic process requesting to attend another district school. Although this high school has a good reputation among White, middle-class families from east-side communities, the graduation rate at this high school for students from Birch is an abysmal 25 percent. High school officials have noted that a very high percentage of their school’s overall tardies come from students living in “the [Birch] zip code,” and it is well known that teachers at the high school regularly comment on the “problems” they face with “those kids from [Birch].” So Mr. More was engaged in what he called a “focused PR [public relations] campaign” to change the perception of his school, ",
