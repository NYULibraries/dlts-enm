            "pageText": "Implied here is that such change is both necessary and possible, and that it is possible through strategies outlined by the federal government and carried out by individual districts, schools, principals, and teachers. Schools that are awarded SIG funds must undergo significant reform under one of four models outlined by the U.S. Department of Education:\n      \n        1.\tTransformation model. Replace the principal, reform instruction, increase learning time, and provide “flexibility and support.”\n        2.\tTurnaround model. Same as transformation model, but also must replace at least 50 percent of the staff.\n        3.\tRestart model. Close the school and reopen it as a charter school.\n        4.\tSchool-closure model. Close the school and reassign students to a higher-performing school.\n      \n      Of the schools awarded SIG funds thus far nationwide, 74 percent have adopted the transformation model, 20 percent have adopted the turnaround model, 4 percent have adopted the restart model, and 2 percent have adopted the school-closure model. In other words, the model requiring the least drastic measures has been adopted by the most number of schools. This is not surprising when viewed through a lens of whiteness: Acquiescence to the status quo allows inequity to go unquestioned and unaddressed.\n      Inequity also thrives because, within the SIG reform model, there is a mismatch between the location of power and the location of responsibility. As one Birch teacher described, “So the district says, ‘Here’s how you’re going to do it.’ The school implements it, it doesn’t work, and then it feels like it’s the teachers’ fault or the school’s fault.” The power of the purse strings and decisions with broad impact lie at the federal and state levels and, to some degree, with districts. But the responsibility for change and blame when things do not go well lies with schools, principals, and teachers. The federal government holds the funds, defines the options for school-improvement models that schools can adopt, and determines eligibility requirements. The states then distribute funds based on competitive applications, and they monitor the implementation of school-improvement efforts. But the principals and teachers ultimately carry out the hard work and, more important, take the blame when efforts do not produce the sought-after results. Thus the schooling of youth is determined by policies and decisions made far removed from their immediate space and place. This mismatch is not unlike the patterns I described in chapter 1, whereby responsibility for equity is displaced, making accountability for equity almost impossible. The tendency to relinquish responsibility is consistent with both niceness and the liberal privileging of individual autonomy ",
