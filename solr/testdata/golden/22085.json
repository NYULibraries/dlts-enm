And this brings into question the extent to which the institutions of her legal order are in fact answerable to her in ways that mark her not as a mere addressee of the law—the subject of the law—but as a citizen or author of the law. That is, the internal account brings into question the institutional adequacy of the status quo from the citizen’s perspective.\nThus far I have set out the first reason to prefer the internal account—it provides an immanent justification for democratic legal order, one that works entirely in our legal and political traditions. It is at this stage that the first reason starts to shade into a second, which has to do with the way that the account submits itself to politics in a way that makes it very different from political liberalism. At the same time as it makes a stand on its truth, it commits that truth to debate in politics as well as questioning, if need be, the ways in which existing institutions set limits to and structure public reason. If law is to be legitimate, legal institutions must do more than facilitate the debate involving truth claims that political liberalism seeks to screen out through the discipline of public reason. These institutions must be submitted to the kind of questioning from within that can lead to changes in the ways in which the institutions set the limits of public reason.\nIn taking this last step, the internal account provides a fuller justification than does the one offered by political liberalism. For even though political liberalism declares itself to be political and “not metaphysical,”58  to offer no arguments other than political ones for its conception of legitimate politics, it does not remain true to that declaration. Rather, it seeks to bury its truth claims, revealing them only when fundamentally challenged. This tells us, as I have suggested, that the declaration requires the impossible. Political liberalism, or any political position, must both make clear its truth claims and be prepared to debate them in politics. Habermas at times seems to want to take the same step as the internal account. But he in effect finds himself in the same position as political liberalism because his theory of communication also amounts to an attempt to shield the truth of his theory from politics.\nConsider, for example, debates about limits on freedom of expression in which groups argue for either limits on pornographic ",
