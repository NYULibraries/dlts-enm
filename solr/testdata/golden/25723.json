The contact between God and men is revelation, the contact between God and the world is creation, the contact between man and the world is redemption.\nHow do we know that such contacts do indeed take place? The emergence of ever higher forms of life in the cosmic surge of evolution is one answer, demonstrating the continuance of Divine creation. And this argument has been elaborated in such philosophies as those of Henri Bergson and S. H. Alexander. Rosenzweig is interested more in the testimony of the human soul and in the evidence provided by the history of mankind. Out of the travail of his own soul, he had learned that currents of Divine love come to us in blessed moments, like healing rays from the sun, transforming our nature and stamping it with the seal of eternity. These sudden bursts of love from above he describes as acts of revelation, and the experience of Divine revelation he accounts to be the source of piety, and the final foundation of true philosophy.\n“Whoever has not yet been reached by the voice of revelation has no right to accept the thought of creation as if it were a scientific hypothesis.”\nAll philosophers, who derived their inspiration from Aristotle, shied away from attributing love to God. Does not love imply needing someone else for self-fulfillment, whereas God is self-sufficient and perfect? Rosenzweig finds in love the one key to the ultimate processes of being. “Love is like language itself, sensual-suprasensual.” Love, he points out, comes in two phases—the love of the lover and the beloved. God’s love or revelation is the love of the lover, a “momentary self-transformation,” shifting from eternity into time, from the absolute stillness of His Being into contact with a particular person or people.\nLove is essentially a give and take proposition. Hence, it is experienced in the flow of speech and the rapture of song, while it eludes forever the static mesh of mathematical logic. God’s healing Grace, and the receptive humble human soul meet on the fleeting borderline of time and eternity, in an event so utterly unique as to be indescribable. A dialogue between two people in love, who find in each other the fulfillment of their life, furnishes the closest analogy to the event of revelation.\n“Does God take the first step, or does man? Is it possible for man to take it? This is a real question. . . . The whole matter continues in the form of an unending dialogue. . . “35\nWhile the love of the lover is arbitrary and momentary, the awakened ",
