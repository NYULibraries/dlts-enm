            "pageText": "refers to a particular point at the beginning of chapter 13 in Book VI, when Maggie and Stephen drift off together, where \"the narrator’s point of view [merges] with Maggie's\" (49).\nThe autobiographical nature of the novel is well known. Jane McDonnell is among the critics who have noted parallels between the Maggie-Tom relationship and the relationship between Eliot and her brother Isaac (381), who, although close in early childhood, had grown increasingly distant and finally cut off all communication with her in 1857, when she had finally told him of her liaison with G. H. Lewes. I would add that there are also parallels in the patterns of Maggie’s and Mary Ann Evans’s young-adult relationships with other men–relationships which involved dependence on men unavailable for marriage.\nFollowing the March 1841 move with her father to Coventry before Isaac’s marriage, Mary Ann seems to have replaced her evangelical enthusiasm, including her enthusiasm for her friendship with her former teacher, Maria Lewis, with a new enthusiasm for scientific studies and a different group of friends, along with a heightened susceptibility to infatuations for men. Judging from her letters at the time, she had suffered anxiety over Isaac’s approaching marriage because of her fear that a new sister-in-law might supersede her as housekeeper at Griff. She wrote Lewis in May 1840 that \"there seems a probability of my being an unoccupied damsel\" (Letters 1:50); in October she was still in a state of uncertainty about what would happen to her when Isaac married (68). Once the decision to leave Griff with her father was made, however, she seemed to regard the move itself with mild annoyance. She wrote at the time that \"we are undergoing one of the chief among the minor disagreeables of life–moving\" (85). Yet afterward, she felt something more like grief. Besides missing her \"lack of a free range for walking which I so enjoyed at Griff,\" she found \"what I did not fully anticipate, a considerable disturbance of the usual flow of thought and feeling on being severed from the objects so long accustomed to call it forth. There is the same cope . . . clouds . . . verdure . . . but I have never yet enjoyed that communion with them, viewed from my present position, that long familiarity rendered spontaneous in my early home\" (93). Perhaps the move from her childhood home at Griff, occurring in conjunction with Isaac’s marriage, came to symbolize the loss of her childhood, and created in her a need for new attachments to which she could transfer the strong feelings of her childhood. In any case, she responded with alacrity ",
