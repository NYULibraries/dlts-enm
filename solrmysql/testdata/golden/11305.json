During the ten years since joining the company, freshly armed with a prestigious doctorate, he has risen steadily and dramatically through the ranks to have now surpassed some of those who hired him. Dr. de A observes that he sees things in quite a different way from his colleagues and superiors, and is perturbed by the darkly pessimistic, self-critical conclusions he draws. His career trajectory is at once self-evident and mystifying to him.\nDr. de A is his parents’ third child; his sister and brother are twelve and ten years older, respectively. He grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where his father was a narrow-gauge railway engineer who suffered unfathomable depressions until his death some ten years ago. Locked into a monotonous job, Dr. de A’s father struggled all his life with feeling unwanted and out of place. The father had been born a twin, but his brother died when they were two.

My father felt deeply, but converted it into a personal sense of loss and failure by comparing himself with others.”\nDr. de As mother was a housewife. Her dismay at finding herself pregnant again, with him, had far-reaching consequences. The paternal grandmother, with whom Dr. de As father eventually severed all ties, tried to persuade her daughter-in-law that this inconvenient pregnancy would produce an extraordinary child. Instead of becoming emotionally reconciled to the pregnancy, Dr. de As mother concretely incorporated her mother-in-law’s notion by evolving a pattern of communication in which Dr. de As accomplishments are the only topic on which he himself is permitted to engage her. A current example: Dr. de A calls to ask if she can ",
