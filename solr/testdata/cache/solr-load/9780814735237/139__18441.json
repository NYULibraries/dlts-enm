He found that this success was achieved despite conventional predictors of poverty and unemployment (the fact that Mexicans were the group with the least competitive human capital attributes—i.e., education, English proficiency, skills, work experience—and the most limited access to automobiles for commuting). About half of the African Americans surveyed held secondary “black” jobs (low wage, low skilled, and poor working conditions) and the same proportion of Mexicans had secondary “Mexican” jobs. However, unlike African Americans, Mexicans were not “mired in prototypically ‘secondary’ jobs” especially when those without high school diplomas were compared. Median wages for Mexicans were about the same as for Puerto Ricans, but higher than for African Americans, contradicting the theory that Mexicans are favored by employers for their exploitable nature.27\nIn order to get a better sense of these findings, other research provides possible explanations. The “discriminatory predispositions” of Chicago employers were examined, and as with Ong and Valenzuela’s Los Angeles results, immigrant workers—be they Mexican, Asian, or eastern European—were consistently praised and preferred. Employers’ prejudice against African American workers was conspicuous.28\nThese labor economic surveys confirm a serious societal evil—employers continue to discriminate against African Americans. Thus, in areas of the country such as Los Angeles and Chicago where a ready supply of low-wage immigrant workers exists, employers with discriminatory instincts against African Americans choose immigrants over low-skilled, less educated African Americans. Solving this problem is a matter of eradicating prejudice, and the degree to which keeping aliens out would contribute to changing racist attitudes about African Americans is questionable. At the very least, we should think carefully about whether attempting to change attitudes at the expense of others who are also generally disadvantaged is the strategy we really want to pursue.\nAnecdotes of job loss must, however, be considered in light of other findings that support the hypothesis that immigrants are not taking jobs that are either available to or desired by African Americans. An analysis of the hotel and restaurant sectors suggests that African Americans have opted out of these sectors in response to rising expectations. For example, some employers perceive that African American employees “just ",
