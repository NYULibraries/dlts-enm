            "pageText": "the program was discontinued in 1994, only about 20 percent of this target was met. The program’s disappointing outcomes were blamed on a lack of capacity and limited commitment from the local implementing agencies (Chatterji 2005; World Bank 1997). Noting that seven different agencies had been charged with implementing aspects of the program, the World Bank’s self-assessment concluded that “this project has shown that the ability of BMRDA and GOM to successfully coordinate large, multi-agency programs remains weak” (World Bank 1997, ii). The report went on to note that because SUP was simply integrated into these agencies’ other activities, it was not deemed a major priority by project administrators. Just one housing program among many, including SIP, the PMGP, and, later, the Slum Re-Development (SRD) program, ALIS, the World Bank’s evaluation noted, “was undermined by competition from several parallel programs that financed essential infrastructure in slums, or provided new, free (or almost-free) housing to slum dwellers” (World Bank 1997, ii). As reflected in the World Bank’s assessment and echoed by others who have looked at these programs, the ALIS and SUP were undermined by the competing agendas that the numerous agencies charged with their implementation pursued (Chatterji 2005; Panwalkar 1995; Dua 1989). Despite the technical assistance provided to the state government and the BMRDA to improve governance outcomes, the state lacked the authority, resources, and ultimately the interest to coordinate among these varied agencies to markedly improve conditions in Bombay’s slums.\n      Clearance and Mobilization\n      Even as these programs were under way, the Maharashtra government was carrying out violent demolition drives reminiscent of the evictions of the Emergency period. Specifically, the state of Maharashtra and BMC launched “Operation Eviction” in July 1981 and “Operation Demolition” in late 1985 (Sebastian 1981; Singh and Das 1995; Mukhija 2003; Chatterji and Mehta 2007; Anand and Rademacher 2011). These clearance campaigns were undertaken amid ongoing turbulence and deep political contestations in the city, the burdens of which were experienced once again by the city’s most vulnerable residents. These actions further demonstrated the halfhearted commitment the government had to the slum improvement and upgradation programs it was simultaneously pursuing. They also had the important consequence of mobilizing a wide swath of activists around housing issues and slum dwellers’ rights. These mobilizations and the dense field of housing rights organizations they produced ",
