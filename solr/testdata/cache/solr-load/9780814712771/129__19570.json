The Korean women demanded that the Japanese government apologize to every victim and provide each one with full compensation.\nThe Japanese military, having procured Korean women as “comfort girls” for its own military men during World War II, then made Korean women available to American military during the U.S. occupation. Japanese journalist Yayori Matsui revealed how prostitution became part of the provisions made for the occupation forces in Japan at the end of World War II:\nAfter its defeat in World War II, the Japanese government presented Japanese women as “comfort girls” to the United Occupation Forces. It is reported that at the cabinet meeting held on August 21, 1945, only six days after the V-J surrender, Konoe Fumimaro, then State Minister without Portfolio, made the following proposal: “We must take emergency measures to protect our women and children from sex-starved American soldiers.” Three days later, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters began to gather members of the red-light trade and request, “As a stopgap measure to protect the flower-like purity of 40,000,000 respectable Japanese women, we would like you to open facilities to ‘comfort’ the American troops.” The government proposed to contribute indirectly 50 million yen (roughly equivalent to $5 million at the present exchange rate) to help meet their expenses. . . .\nA ceremony to proclaim the establishment of the “Association for the Creation of Special Recreational Facilities” (later the “Recreation and Amusement Association,” nicknamed R.A.A.) was held in the square in front of the Imperial Palace on August 28 to coincide with the landing of the first contingent of American occupation troops.

R.A.A. army brothels literally sprouted up before the smoke could clear from the bombed-out rubble of Tokyo, and within three months there were twenty-five such brothels. ...
