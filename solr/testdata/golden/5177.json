If that is true and Marius is right, the historical profession has two choices: change our ideas about what it means for our students to “write” about the past, or fade into irrelevance. If you do not believe me, consider the results of a survey 200 students in Michael Wesch's Cultural Anthropology class at Kansas State University conducted on themselves in the fall of 2007. After analyzing one another, those students determined that in that year they would read eight books, 2,300 web pages, and 1,281 Facebook profiles. In the fall semester they would write 42 pages for various classes, but 500 pages of email.5 Now consider that these students surveyed themselves in 2007, not 2012. As ubiquitous as Facebook was in 2007, it had not yet achieved its current almost total capture of the American undergraduate student population.6 These data also do not capture the thousands of text messages the average college student will write in a single semester. As mentioned in chapter 1, a substantial fraction of those 2,300 web pages will offer up hundreds or perhaps thousands of hours of video they will watch on their computers. A substantial fraction of today's students will have a blog; a Twitter feed; will publish and mark up photographs; will insert tags on images, videos, blog posts, and Facebook profiles; will create online videos; and will write entries for databases. And perhaps many will write comments ranging from a few words to many hundreds on content they find online.7\nNone, or at least very little, of this “writing” they do on various websites and in various media has anything to do with what we call academic historical writing—at least from the standpoint of form. What they say may be said in precise, analytical language, but more likely it is going to be casual in tone and form. Does that make it less insightful? Perhaps, but not always. This chapter considers how, going forward from 2013, we need to think very carefully about how to teach students to organize, make sense of, and present history in the intermediated world they inhabit.8 My purpose is not to argue that the five-page essay is dead as a form of historical writing in the college course—even though to our students it may already be their version of Banquo's ghost—dead, but annoyingly haunting. Instead, I suggest a number of ways to think about how students can and will represent the results of their historical investigations in a variety of forms, only one of which is the essay. Writing a solid historical essay is still a very important skill that students need to develop, but it is also incumbent upon us as their teachers and mentors to help them mine these various forms of presenting historical information for all they are worth, while helping them remain true to the values of our profession.\n",
