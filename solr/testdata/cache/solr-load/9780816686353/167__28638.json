            "pageText": "Even though newspapers sometimes acknowledged that discrimination might play a role in a student’s chances for success, these concerns were usually outweighed by the belief in a framework that stressed individual merit over structural factors. The mainstream media’s tendency to focus on individual stories discouraged journalists from interrogating the validity of this interpretative frame. Even though special reports and personal testimonies of successful immigrant students were meant to add a human perspective and emphasize some laudable achievements, they had another, much more problematic effect in the context of the larger discourse.9 By providing a multitude of personal success stories without much reference to the structural factors that had enabled these particular students to thrive, the mainstream media fostered the belief that scholastic performance was only determined by individual merit. By focusing on specific groups, most notably Asian Americans, the news media also validated the existing belief that some groups were more prone to success than others.\nPolls demonstrate that many readers already believed that Asian immigrants were less threatening, more successful, and thus ultimately more desirable than Latinos. As part of a special ten-part series about immigrants who had gained amnesty in 1986, for example, the Houston Chronicle conducted a series of telephone interviews of 828 adult Texans. The results are interesting on a number of levels. While authors Thaddeus Herrick and James Pinkerton asserted that most Texans had a fairly positive attitude toward immigrants and immigration, they also found that there was a huge gap between Texans’ perceptions of Asian and Hispanic immigrants. According to their interviews, “nearly half of all Texans say Hispanics are ‘very or extremely likely’ to cause higher taxes . . . while one-quarter say the same about Asians. Similarly, Texans are more likely to believe Hispanics, rather than Asians, cause an increase in crime and cause the quality of education to decline” (HC, October 20, 1996).10 Yet, despite these striking differences, Texans did not think of themselves as prejudiced or even racist. To the contrary, the majority portrayed themselves as open minded and welcoming of other cultures. Asked whether the growing number of Hispanics would improve American culture and add positive ideas and customs, for instance, 77.6 percent responded that this was at least somewhat likely.11\nThis type of reasoning is symptomatic of the larger discourse about immigrants and immigration. While American citizens, their elected officials, as well as the media were willing to celebrate diverse cultures ",
