Malte’s reaction to his father’s death and to the perforation of his heart, taken together with the passages concerning fathers in The Book of Hours that I explored in the preceding chapter, supports this conclusion.\nThe need to resolve guilt and undo harm through the transference relationship with the sculptor may have diminished because of the poet’s efforts toward the end of Josef’s life to win his father’s approval and to inspire his confidence and hope that his son would be a great success in his chosen profession.\nThe changes in Rilke during the years 1902–6 and his response to his father’s aging, illness, and death suggest that Rodin’s supportive, confirming, affectionate fathering had provided him with an ideal model of a father as a highly successful, gifted artist, whom he could introject and with whom he could identify himself. As a result he had gained a stronger sense of his own identity, value, and direction as an artist, as well as greater confidence in his own inner guidance. By May 1906, as I have pointed out, he had written a few of the finest of the New Poems and was bursting with readiness to do new work.\nConsidering his state of mind when he had come to Paris in 1902, we can see how much he had developed through the transference relationship with Rodin. All the inner strength and maturity he had gained through this relationship had made him ready to accept the loss of Josef, the finality of his father’s separateness and absence in death. As he realized that he had reached this point, he must have understood that he was also ready to accept the separateness and the loss of the second father whom he had so desperately needed when he came to Paris. Offering insights which clarify this change in Rilke, Modell observes that the internalization of an affectionate parent can enable a person to love and be a parent to himself, and that these developments, along with the growth of a person’s sense of his differentiation, can foster his ability to accept the loss of persons he loves, particularly parents.6 Modell also remarks that where strength and health are lacking, due to childhood failure to identify with “good enough” parents, psychoanalytic therapy “can provide in part the experience of ‘good enough’ parental care, and an identification with the analyst can become a permanent part of the patient’s ego.”7 I suggest that something like this happened in Rilke’s transference with Rodin. And perhaps Josef’s death enabled the poet to feel that the psychological “work” which had so badly needed doing when he first ",
