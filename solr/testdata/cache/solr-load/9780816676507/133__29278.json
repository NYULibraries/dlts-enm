Representatives from the Brown Berets, Black Congress, LA SNCC, SDS, Peace Action Council, Freedom Draft Movement, and Veterans for Peace all spoke. Los Angeles Free Press (“Freep”) reporter Jim Osborn noted that it “was the first mass demonstration in Los Angeles featuring speakers from black and brown militant organizations combined with whites since the Watts uprising pronounced the death of the integration movement in 1965.” He also observed that all of the speakers criticized war and domestic racism. For example, Ted Millikoff from Veterans for Peace echoed a common refrain on the hypocrisies of Black treatment in the United States: “We want the war of oppression perpetrated on the black and brown community in America to stop, now!  …  We don’t want any more civil rights bills—we want the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States enforced.”23\nAlliances were forged and strengthened during and following the LAPD SWAT force’s early-morning assault on the Panther headquarters in December 1969 (see Figure 4).

And if anybody doubts they are gestapo, they should know about it now.”24\nA demonstration held the next day drew more than six thousand people to City Hall. All of the speakers emphasized that Black organizations were the target of systematic militarized police repression and the community as a whole was the target of genocide. Tear gas hindered cleanup efforts, but the Black Student Alliance, Che-Lumumba Club, white students, Women Strike for Peace, striking electricians, Friends of the Panthers (a largely white support group), and other allies gathered to rebuild the center and to prevent another police attack.25\nThe United Defense Committee, which had formed in 1968, remobilized and sent a letter to the ACLU contending that police repression of the Panthers gave a green light for right-wing paramilitary organizations’ domestic terrorism.
