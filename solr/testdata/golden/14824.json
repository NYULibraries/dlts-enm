            "pageText": "Reviewing his files, I read many letters to the editor and short articles sent to newspapers and returned to him with one excuse or another as to why the newspaper declined to publish the material. Even when published, his writings have been sometimes revised and subdued. Yet, Dov has not been discouraged from continuing his struggle against injustice. The articles written about him never neglected to mention the fact that he had been a highranking officer in the IDF. One can recall that Yirmiya completed his service as a career officer in 1958, and yet in The Jerusalem Post of May 1988, the article reads, “Colonel admits to urging soldiers to refuse to serve in the territories.” The adjectives colonel (Sgan-Aluf) and ex-officer have always been associated with his name and activities. Indeed, in Israel one’s army rank is usually associated with the person. This is particularly evident in the case of highranking officers, mainly generals, who hold prominent public positions as civilians. In Dov’s case, it was usually noted in order to emphasize his criticism of the IDF and his involvement in the peace camp.\nOne of the best descriptions of Yirmiya was written by Menachem Golan in Maar’iv on October 8, 1982. The article, titled “Persona non Grata,” evokes an emotional and painful reaction to Yirmiya’s expulsion from the army. This was still a time when Yirmiya refrained from openly attacking the IDF. Golan quotes Yirmiya as saying, “Yes, I will volunteer in the future, and will ask to serve in the IDF wherever it goes. It is my army and my country, and no one will take them from me. I gave them my whole life.” Note, however, that since the Intifada broke out, Yirmiya has no longer abided by his own words.\nBetween 1967 and 1979 Dov documented the bulk of his activities himself. There were only a few clippings from 1967 to 1978, but since 1979 his files have grown to include hundreds of documents. Dov’s explanation as to this discrepancy was that only after his retirement in 1978–1979 did he find the time to write so many letters and responses to the press, and to organize his files. However, knowing Dov, I think that consciously or unconsciously he is more at peace with the last ten to twenty years of his life than with the years prior to 1970. After talking with Dov, I was under the impression that he is restructuring his own vision of his life.\nAnother issue relevant to Dov’s emergence as a political activist is his political affiliation. All his life Dov declared himself a member of Mapam, at one time the most leftist Socialist-Zionist party. ",
