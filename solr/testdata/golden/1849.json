Internal issues that have gained international notoriety include high profile examples such as child labor, suppression of the Falun Gong, the destruction of Tibet, and the absence of a free press. China has been criticized for pursuing a foreign policy that supports violations of human rights in Sudan and, most recently, Burma. As to some of these issues, particularly in foreign policy, geopolitical opinions may differ. But from the perspective of the “rehabilitation function,” the award to China was in the category of aspiration rather than recognition of accomplished change. There are those who hope that the Games will act as a mechanism for pressuring China to address its violations of a Western-constructed human rights regime. For instance, Beijing has had a contractual obligation to the IOC that requires it to develop the 2008 Games according to strict IOC regulations. Further, the Olympics placed an international spotlight on China and it is now contending with a much greater level of scrutiny. China is not immune to this pressure as its response to the “Genocide Olympics” campaign indicates, but the minimal adjustments it has made thus far suggest that China will by and large continue to pursue its existing policies. Ultimately, China has little reason to give in to pressure. It is not South Korea, dependent on increasing foreign investment and support to develop. Thus, the expectations of international human rights groups and other actors who are attempting to use Beijing 2008 to further their goals must be tempered by the recognition of the fact that China is already deeply and irreversibly integrated into the interdependent global political economy.\nThe dynamics of Sochi 2014 are similar to Beijing 2008. Russia is a powerful global actor with a strong economy. Despite inconsistent commitments to democracy Russia's global influence continues to grow. Sochi's bid committee, which included Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Zhukov and finance minister Alexei Krudrin (Sochi 2014 Bid Committee 2007b), constructed a bid that appeared to hint and nod to the rehabilitation themes of traditional Olympic internationalism but with language so subtle as to recognize the global shift. This is perhaps best captured in the Sochi bid's Olympic Vision, which states that the Winter Olympics is expected to “drive positive change across multiple areas of social life, including integration of people with disabilities, environmental awareness, corporate transparency and accountability” (Sochi 2014 Bid Committee 2007d). In the bid, Sochi addresses the role of the Olympics as an agent of change, but in a carefully\n",
