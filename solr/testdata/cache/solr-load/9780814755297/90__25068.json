            "pageText": "survivor can empower herself without help from others. Sharing our social contexts and “unpacking” the gender-loaded political meanings that work to keep us cycling in a wheel of self-destructiveness is part of how we assist each other, part of how we empower ourselves. When we rely on empowering ourselves in isolation, despair can be the result. When we are desperate we are more likely than not to turn to some individualized method of coping that works to mask as well as manage the enormity of our pain. Note Samantha’s pattern of coping:\nThe only person I could ever trust was myself, the only person who could save me was myself. My caretakers were either abusive or were not saving me, they were not rescuing me. So I could not trust anyone. I think insofar as I could not turn to any sort of benign God for comfort, I had to be able to do something that I could do for myself—you know—I mean, my parents certainly had no clue how to comfort me. So I turned to food. I had to do it; comfort wasn’t one of the options in my family.\nSamantha used food to rescue herself when God and her parents would not. Food become a vehicle to transcend her experience of feeling emotionally desolate. Surrendering to a Higher Power is not the solution. Rather, breaking out of isolation with affirming and conscious others is paramount for survivors, like Samantha, who tend to isolate. It seems that dependence on a paternal rescue and isolating and seeking self-soothing rituals in private are two sides to the same culturally gendered “coin.”\nFood consumption or its refusal can indeed work to displace the anxiety and depression one develops as a result of the trauma of sexual abuse. Self-psychologists Richard Ulman and Doris Brothers define addictive trigger mechanisms as “specific substances, behaviors, or persons (e.g., alcohol, drugs, food, sexual partner, or gambling) that are used on a habitual and compulsive basis to arouse archaic narcissistic fantasies and accompanying moods of narcissistic bliss, which in turn provide desperately needed antianxiety and/or antidepressant relief from dysphoric affect states.”12 Samantha used food (as well as drugs and alcohol) to soothe her in ways her parents were unable to. All nine of these survivors reveal narcissistic deprivation due to parental failure. The intrusions of incest reinforce this deprivation, which led the survivor to seek escape. The most tangible escape route a child can find and experience is food binging, which works to anesthetize her deprivation and ",
