            "pageText": "and more complete portrait of ourselves and the world that we hope to create. Far from the ugly, threatening image our opponents advance, lesbian and gay visions of the future have much practical and moral value for the rest of the world. Their components include the freedom of self-expression, newfound respect for families of all configurations, encouragement to listen to our hearts and trust where they lead, an escape from the constraints of those labels and boxes that confine or suffocate individual minds and spirits, and the right to love whomever we choose without penalty or fear.\nThis is not some monstrous “gay agenda” that attacks families, children, religion, and morality. However, that is what our opponents would have the public believe, must have them believe in order to perpetuate hatred and fear. The way to counter these predominant images is not to remain silent or hidden but to make our own visions come alive by speaking honestly of ourselves, our lives, and the transformations we hope to achieve. This is our duty regardless of our own sexual orientation, regardless of the breadth of our sphere of influence. Every one of us must participate in this effort, in every possible forum, at every possible opportunity, wherever we can do so without unduly risking our safety or sacrificing those things we must have to survive. In creating this alternative image, a portrait forever in process, the artistic vision of each of us is not only welcome but vital. When we all speak and act, when we create a vivid and colorful mosaic with the stories of our lives, only then will those around us begin to see us and hear us as we are, and as we can be.\nCONCLUSION\nClearly, resolving the issue of how best to pursue liberation is beyond the scope of any single study, calling for broader and more varied perspectives than can be provided by any one individual. These are issues for gays and lesbians and our communities to ponder and for legal scholars and activists to debate. They are questions that must concern all of us who advocate an end to homophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of oppression. They must inevitably be of concern to those who count a lesbian or gay man among their family or friends. They must, finally, concern all of us who work with or care about young people, those who are at the greatest risk from the perilous effects of oppression. This includes not only gay and lesbian youth themselves but also the legions of young people who are questioning and uncertain. Among this generation, the ravages of homophobia may become the roots of unmanageable, ultimately insurmountable self-hatred and fear.\n",
