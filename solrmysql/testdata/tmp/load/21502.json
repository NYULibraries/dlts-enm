In a strict Keynesian sense, the effect of the trade deficit was to cancel the demand stimulus generated by the fiscal deficit. Over the years 1981–89, the total increments to the fiscal deficit, compared to its level in 1980, were $827.4 billion. In the same interval, the increments to the trade deficit, again compared to its 1980 level, were $718.4 billion. Since in the Keynesian model, these operate in opposite directions the combined additional demand stimulus from these two sources was $109 billion, or $12.1 billion a year. In a world in which the annual level of gross national product averaged a little more than four trillion dollars, this represents about three-tenths of one percent of GNP, hardly a major source of aggregate-demand stimulus. Besides, coincident with the presence of federal budget deficits were state and local government surpluses that amounted to an average of $48 billion a year during the eighties.37 With these included, the combined stimulus from the fiscal and trade deficits is negative.\nBeyond those simple aggregate numbers, there is an intriguing pattern in the movements of the fiscal and trade deficit. This year’s fiscal deficit anticipates next year’s trade deficit. This is shown in figure 12.4 where the increase in the fiscal deficit in any given year is related to the trade deficit of the following year. The similarity in the movements of the two data series is clear. What this suggests is that any positive stimulus to aggregate demand from the fiscal deficit this year is roughly canceled out next year by a negative stimulus arising out of the trade deficit. Of course, this relationship could be just a coincidental one. However, there is a line of reasoning that would link the movements in the fiscal and trade deficits. Fiscal deficits raise the real interest rate, which encourages capital inflows into the United States, which influence exchange rates in a fashion that encourages a greater volume of imports.38 More than that, the nature of the nation’s balance of payments is such that the excess of imports over exports should roughly equal the capital inflows. With an appropriate set of elasticities in the markets for loanable funds, the linkage we have described in figure 12.4 is a possible one. However, the importance of the observation that any aggregate-demand stimulus resulting from the fiscal deficit was very largely canceled out by movements in the trade deficit does not turn on the linkage between the two being systematic.\n",
