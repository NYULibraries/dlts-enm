            "pageText": "after they fall into the habit of absenting themselves from their people every Sunday to run around naked and swim in the lake, “wanton, witch-like girls, liking eccentric and forbidden ways.”158 The phallic shape of the female serpent, of course, only highlights the antagonistic confrontation between male and female sexuality in animal bride stories.\nIt is the castrating power of the deer woman that the Poncas especially fear when they describe how her chosen victim “could not go to any other woman, no matter how much he loved and wanted her. The Deer Woman held him with her magic eyes,” but killed him when she “trampled his genitals with her knife-edge hooves. Even if he had lived, he would never have been a man again.”159 As noted above, in this contemporary retelling of the traditional Ponca tale, young women become prostitutes under deer woman’s influence, but the essential themes remain unchanged: the prototypically evil woman spawns other female deviants, whose unbridled sexuality attacks the basic fiber of society, which is often linked to male sexual prowess.\nAbout this theme, animal mate stories are frequently ambiguous. Sometimes male sexuality is equated with nature and culture, whereas despite the critical role woman plays within culture, female sexuality (outside the context of childbearing) tends to be associated only with nature. But at other times, animal mates of either sex represent the dangerous lure of gross matter. Bear spouse stories of North America are often particularly explicit on this point. Frequently a woman must step on bear feces to qualify as the animal’s wife;160 correspondingly, men who take bear wives are drawn to the beasts’ completely unsocialized behavior, and at the same time are repulsed by it. That woman is victimized by such ambivalence appears to be the point of an Ojibwa story that tells how “Bird-Hawk lived with a woman; very much he hated her, for attempt was made by her to be intimate with him; and so throughout the whole of every night he was kept awake by her. Truly no desire did he have to be intimate with the woman.”161 It is because he recoils from her that she becomes a bear. The Chippewa convey a similar theme by playing an interesting variation on the burned animal skin motif. The “Bear Girl” of the story’s title marries a man who finds himself repelled by his bride. “She would sit by her husband, and he’d start moving away. When they went to bed, her husband bundled himself up in a blanket and turned the other way. She told her husband that she was very sad that he did that. She said, ‘Since you don’t like me ",
