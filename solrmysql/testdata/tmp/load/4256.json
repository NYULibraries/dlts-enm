Memory is passed down through generations; history is revised.”6 Writing history in the digital age will force professional historians to share a space (i.e., the Internet) with others whose narratives draw on the “sacred set of potentially absolute meanings” that characterize popular memory. Nowhere is this characteristic of the web more apparent than in Wikipedia, which, for good or ill, provides more historical information to the public than any other site on the web. When you type any historical topic into the search engine of your choice, chances are excellent that the first hit will be Wikipedia. Its extensive entries demonstrate the ways in which popular understandings shape digital narratives about the past.\nWhy explore writing history through Wikipedia? Simply put, because it allows any reader to peel away layers of narrative to explore how entries have changed over time, juxtaposing revisions for comparison. In keeping with its self-fashioned identity as a community of writers, Wikipedia also maintains discussion pages for each entry that permit even the casual visitor—as well as the scholar bent on digital history—to follow the give and take between different contributors. In short, Wikipedia invites readers to peer behind the curtain and, if interested, take a place at the controls. This open-source quality has troubled many observers, who question the accuracy of Wikipedia's entries and/or deny that it has any utility as a reference source for students and the wider public. Rather than discuss its accuracy, however, I wish to explore the process by which Wikipedia contributors craft entries about the past. Despite protestations that its entries may not serve as either a “soapbox” or “memorial site,” Wikipedia is not simply an online encyclopedia.7 Its historical entries serve as virtual “sites of memory” (to borrow from Pierre Nora), places at which people attempt to codify the meaning of past events.8 Moreover, as they discuss and debate the language used to narrate the past, Wikipedia contributors may strive for a “neutral point of view” (NPOV), but in practice, they judge new entries and revisions via a moral economy of crowdsourcing.9\nHow does Wikipedia depict past events? How do contributors resolve debates about history? What happens when popular understandings (memory) clash with academic discourse (history)? To answer these questions, I traced a single entry for the “Origins of the American Civil War” (OACW) beginning with its first appearance in December 2003, when anonymous “User 172” posted a dense, 9,700-word essay accompanied by two images. Since then, more than 900 other users (some of them automated) have updated the page,10 which now consists of roughly 19,000 words, 14 images, four maps, copious notes and bibliography. Because debates about the war's origins have often served as proxies for other struggles, such as the 20th-century civil rights movement, the OACW seemed likely to show traces of contestation. Depending on region and background, as a sizable literature demonstrates, the popular understanding of the American Civil War varies tremendously.11 I paid particular attention to skirmishes in the OACW's discussion and history pages (see fig. 4). Most editorial changes elicited no controversy whatsoever; they either added new information or tackled the perennial problems of organization that plague longer Wikipedia entries. I also ignored minor acts of vandalism. For example, for nearly five days in 2004, the phrase “Michael Cox is the coolest kid at CMS” appeared in the OACW; perhaps for those days he was.12 Excepting these pages, considerable discussion about the “Origins of the American Civil War” occurred behind the scenes as contributors challenged one another over terminology, imagery, and context.
