Springsteen’s song of the disillusionment and disappointment facing a Vietnam veteran suits Emmett’s current situation: “You end up like a dog that’s been beat too much / Till you spend half your life just covering up.”48 “Covering up,” literally and metaphorically, has become Emmett’s chief preoccupation. Emmett spends much of his time digging a hole under the house, like “a foxhole to hide in” according to Sam.49\nEmmett is not alone in this desire to hide from past experiences. The townspeople of the ironically named Hopewell also refuse to confront the past, and Sam’s mother has moved away from town in an attempt to make a new life for herself, leaving behind the clothes and music records of her youth. Sadly, Sam’s mother can “hardly even remember” her first husband, Sam’s father.50 Sam’s paternal grandparents possess a vague memory of their son, but they fail to confront the person he became in Vietnam. The clues to this identity are contained in his wartime diary, which they refuse to read. To a degree, the silence that surrounds the past is a result of this failure to confront the past. “You get the feeling,” comments one reviewer of the novel, that the townspeople would tell Sam “if only they could remember.”51 Alternatively, if they could tell her, they would remember. At fault for these characters is not their memory but their refusal or inability to talk. Memory suffers as speech, through which the collective memory is expressed, atrophies. Mason criticizes this situation by evoking the inane language of mass culture and its invasion of the thought and language of these characters. Language itself is impoverished, replaced by acronyms and brand names: MTV, FM, VA, TV, K-Mart, Dodge Dart, Coke, Burger Boy, Holiday Inn. The market culture is so intrusive that Emmett has named his pet cat after a commercial product: Moon Pie.\nHowever, while Mason may be conscious of the impoverishment of language as a result of the commercialization of culture, her own prose also affects the characters’ speech. The prose of the novel is pared to the level of a young adult novel. In one way, this characteristic is a reflection of Mason’s ability to capture the language and thought of her young-adult heroine—however, all the characters and actions in this novel, written in the third person, are described in this language. The naiveté of the authorial voice is, for much of the novel, overdetermined; a problem not alleviated by Mason’s recourse to the cliché that “veterans don’t like to talk up their war experiences.”52 The result is the representation of characters who suffer a triple victimage: they are victims of the war, of their ",
