Where is the balance between male silence and male authority?\nMaintaining this balance is a key responsibility of a male women’s studies teacher. I wonder, even when I remain verbally silent, what other messages I am sending with my body language, my mannerisms, my very presence—messages that my students are long practiced at recognizing and responding to. As Kampf and Ohmann point out, a man teaching in women’s studies “will have to be sensitive about dominating class. He will have to be open to criticism....

I cannot (and should not) shed the evaluative and mentoring authority granted me by my role as a teacher. However, by deflecting the flow of power in the classroom away from me and back to my students so that it flows among all of us in a more or less egalitarian manner, I am able to present myself as a teacher who respects my students’ abilities, knowledge, and experiences as well as their lack thereof. This more horizontal power dynamic supports the creation of a community of learners in the classroom who view me as a more knowledgeable member who can be looked to for guidance and leadership rather than as the authority figure from whom the setting and interpretation of rules are expected.\nTo create such a community, a teacher needs to understand that students are active agents in their own learning processes and to promote an environment that supports this perception among all members.
