I want to explore what it would mean to take the problem with full seriousness and to explain why, in my view, it lays an intellectual burden on us that we cannot: evade but that can become so heavy that it destroys the understanding it is meant to further. The need to respect context, but only within reasonable limits, leads me to a position that is less decisive or less completely decisive than we may find comfortable. Even skeptics are usually firmly skeptical, but I argue sometimes for context or relativism and sometimes against. The cause for this variability is not the unwillingness to decide, but the force majeure that life exerts in the form of such intractable dilemmas as those that will be displayed here.\nThe need to understand everything in context makes it impossible to arrive at a fully objective solution of the intellectual problems created by the differences between cultures; the solutions proposed are always necessarily inadequate. In the effort to overcome this inadequacy, thinkers tend to become polarized and to adopt one of two possible extremesâ€”the one, that the problems are inseparable from their contexts, and the other, that the problems can and often should be divorced from them. Both extremes, I argue, miss or conceal too much, and neither matches our experience well.\nIt is the inexhaustibility of contextual differences that makes it so difficult for the members of one culture to appreciate the position of those of another. The philosophers, anthropologists, and others ",
