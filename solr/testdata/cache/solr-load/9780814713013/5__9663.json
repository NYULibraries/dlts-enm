It is entirely possible, in other words, to have your literature and your cultural studies too, if your literary study is cultural enough and your cultural studies is literary enough.\nThose of my colleagues who fear that cultural studies will replace rather than enrich literary study, by contrast, are skeptical about precisely this point. As William Cain has recently charged, the arrival of new methodologies inevitably entails intellectual trade-offs, such that what we gain in the study of “culture” we must lose in the study of “literature”:\nThe Modern Language Association keeps insisting that the swerve toward cultural studies has not led to the displacement of this kind of close reading. But if you talk to teachers, it becomes evident that, in order to keep up with trends in cultural studies, they are cutting back on the time given to writers and books that students should be discovering and learning how to read. (B4)\nCain’s formulation contains its conclusions, of course: on the one hand, we have writers and books students should learn to read, and on the other hand we have “trends” in cultural studies. To the first we must do justice; with the second we are merely “keeping up.” This pretty much closes out the possibility that Stuart Hall, Eric Lott, or Janice Radway might qualify under both headings, as theorists in cultural studies whom students should discover and learn how to read. But as we shall see, Cain is far from alone in understanding the field in this way; and because our field is made up, in part, precisely by understandings of our field, we cannot chart the present and future of literary study unless we attend to why it is that cultural studies names both a desire and a fear.\nDisciplines in the modern languages, in my view, should always be home to a variety of methodologies that ask what texts mean as well as how texts mean.1 I am happiest, as a critic and as a reader, when I am learning how these two concerns are mutually illuminating—how the formal properties of a text are part of the work that text does in the world, and how its work in the world is enabled or conditioned by our understanding of its properties. But I am not narrowly prescriptive when it comes to asking what kindof work English departments themselves might do in the world. I believe there are any number of ways to ",
