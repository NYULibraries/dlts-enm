Guidelines for HIV counseling from the Department of Health for New York State (1990) point out that “no barrier method, including condoms, can guarantee 100 percent protection as product failure and incorrect use may occur.”44 The patriarchal sexual relations of power account for most of the failure rate as men impose their sex-without-condoms demand on women, and as sex is treated as an uncontrollable, especially male urge that should not be disrupted by stopping to use a condom.\nCondoms have not been entirely ineffective in controlling AIDS. WHO reported that in testing in Zaire, they found that one-third of the prostitutes in Kinsashai tested positive for HIV. Two years later, after a condom campaign, new infections declined from 18% to 3%. However, WHO statistics are not reliable. For example, in a Bangkok “teahouse,” 80% of the prostitutes tested HIV positive although doctors had certified them to be free of AIDS.\nThailand’s National AIDS Committee launched a new campaign for 100% condom use in prostitution. Failure to use condoms carries punishment measures, and the brothel will be closed down if a brothel employee requests medical care for AIDS.45 For each female life infected with AIDS from prostitution in a brothel, the punishment is that the brothel will be shut down for one day. Multimillion-dollar U.S. projects are being implemented worldwide to promote the use of condoms in prostitution as a protection from AIDS, and Thailand reported that condom use rose from 14% to 71.5% by mid-1991.\nHowever, condom use to control AIDS will only be partially effective. Even with the risks there are other factors that make condoms a high-risk strategy for controlling AIDS in prostitution. The fact of multiple sex partners, the refusal of many customers to use condoms especially when they are drunk, and the offer of some customers to pay higher prices if they do not have to use condoms place prostitute women’s lives, and all the other sexual ",
