But Japan’s financial aid in this area is actually used by recipient nations to buy plant, technology, and products from Japan. The beneficiaries of Japan’s ODA policies have been Japanese trading houses and manufacturers. However, it is now time to review Japan’s agricultural policy with two objectives in mind: first, permitting the purchase of rice from Thailand, the United States, and other countries to be used abroad for humanitarian purposes; and, second, using ODA to assist the domestic agricultural sector by moving away from the current system of paying farmers not to grow rice and instead allowing them to produce as much rice as they want and using any surplus as part of Japan’s overseas aid program. This would indeed be a plussum solution that would please the United States and other rice-exporting countries and help Japanese farmers increase their productivity.\nThe third key area is basic research. After the war, the Japanese government and Japanese corporations sent large numbers of their most talented engineers and researchers to study in the labs at MIT and other American universities. Japan was able to do this because America willingly accepted foreign students. In Japan, however, most research is done not in universities but in the laboratories of Japan’s leading corporations, which are reluctant to open their doors to receive the world’s students and researchers or to share research information on the grounds that such information constitutes trade secrets.
