            "pageText": "We may link the paranoid-schizoid element with that of inheritance, and with Dickens’s own predicament. At this stage in his life he must have felt that his massive imaginative efforts had not solved the existential problems to whose solution they were directed. He had made massive efforts at reparation, yet was still in anguish and chaos in his personal emotional life and family circumstances.\nAt some level in his psyche he “knew” that this had to do with the psychic inheritance, and so in this work he explores it again. And in this book the image of the father (as the Mackenzies suggest) is as important as that of the mother. There is not in this novel the punitive woman who seeks to promote guilt and to inflict expiation on an infant who thereby inherits disgrace, like Mrs. Clennam and Esther’s aunt; Miss Havisham is a pitiable figure whose life has been destroyed by her being jilted. In this book, the father figure is at first terrifying, animal, subhuman, yet also pitiable; then he becomes one who has falsified Pip in his own image of the respectability he does not have. But later he becomes like a father who is loved because of his suffering and is understood even for his false attempts to make “his boy” into the image of his own image of his good self.\nThe greatest dangers lie in the meeting between male and female: Estella is the daughter of the convict Magwitch and the murderess who lurks in the background of Jaggers’s house. Compeyson, who hates Magwitch and seeks his death, has destroyed Miss Havisham, whose teaching has perverted Estella. Bentley Drummle is a brutal and coarse husband for Estella. Orlick mutilates and dehumanizes Pip’s sister out of jealousy.\nHow is it possible to triumph over these horrors and the various ways in which they threaten Pip with inauthenticity? The answer is for him not only to gain insight into himself, to mature, but also for him to become capable of love—and the interesting thing about Great Expectations is that the love that is gained has strong homosexual elements. Further, this affection between man and man (as between Pip and Magwitch, Pip and Joe, and Pip and Herbert) may be seen as symbolic of reconciliation with the dangerous male element within the self. Just as the dangerous woman is mollified, so the dangerous male figure (with nameless crimes in the background) is symbolically embraced. Orlick and Bentley Drummle, Compeyson and the early Magwitch are frighteningly menacing male figures. Later, Pip’s love for Magwitch goes with the process of coming to love himself and of feeling secure in his love for Estella.\nThis progress we may link with the problem of finding love to be safe.
