            "pageText": "\nJones was posing as the ambassador of a generation who found the print paper to be a historic relic of a bygone era, something someone's grandmother might read (as he informed viewers). And for Jones and The Daily Show's fans, the only news that mattered was the “real news”—the news that was happening now.\nThe Daily Show's satire underscores a crucial point: The Times was still engaged in producing news for the next-day print newspaper cycle, a fact that seemed antiquated to a comedy show writing for the under-thirty, digitally savvy crowd.2 The segment, of course, fails to mention the 24/7 nytimes.com site that was continually being updated. Also left out was the fact that many journalists were writing “real news” ASAP, today.\n“Aged news” versus “real news,” though, is one way to explain the competing understandings of immediacy at The Times. Immediacy has always been a news value, from Renaissance Europe to the present: getting the news out as fast as possible, as quickly as the technology of the day would allow. In the case of the contemporary print newspaper—the newspaper of the 2000s—immediate meant today's news tomorrow, in print form. The end of the era of multiple editions and the dominance of one-paper news markets generally meant one, single final product capping off a twenty-four-hour news cycle. Breaking news in print form was old compared to CNN's constant streaming feed, of course. For the print paper, breaking news had, ideally, more context, time, and space to be brought to a story. Immediacy was the next day.\nBut in a digital arena, whether the news outlet was broadcast television, cable news, legacy print, radio, or an online-only outlet—none of this mattered. Everyone now shared the same capacity to distribute content at the same time. The Internet meant these news organizations were equalized: whether they liked it or not, they were always on, with audiences always present. The new immediacy of online journalism was ASAP journalism: journalism for now, not journalism for tomorrow.\nWhat The Times faced, then, was a culture clash. Producing the print paper required a mentality that virtually ignored the reality of online journalism. Those primarily concerned with print journalism were thinking about news that would appear in the print paper the next day,\n",
