Far too often members of the class—myself more than most—will find the smallest positives in the gravest of circumstances. Instead, I should recognize the hardships and attack those; find the root of the issues and begin problem solving and evaluate what needs to be changed within the system.\nHannah too felt she had settled for less. “It's not enough to have a creative place,” she wrote.\nIt's not enough to add humanity. That's all nice and really important too, but I think our mission was to do more than that and I was unable to [do that more]…. It takes little to make a theater workshop in prison, but it takes a lot to make it push the women and challenge them and myself to make it realistic and from their own minds and lives.\nThe play, about a high school reunion, “was decidedly about leaving the past behind and moving on with our lives for the better—an incredibly noble message for all the workshop participants4 and everyone in general…[but] we absolutely lost it.” Because many women lost interest and dropped out, Hannah felt she and Sarah Miller had failed to make the space significant.

Like Becky and Christopher, she hurt and learned: “In some ways…I'm glad I failed because it's a blatant slap in the face to make me keep working and acknowledge my own flaws.”\nThe Lincoln Center group had named themselves CoNtRoLLeD CHaOS, and their play, CoNtRoLLeD CHaOS, was one of the liveliest, most varied, most energetic performances in 319. The boys danced, rapped, sang, and presented some very interesting characters and a plot with meaning and some depth. They broke all of Corey's stereotypes, and between that, the reading, and the class discussion, he wrote, “the amount of change that I have experienced this semester has been incredible.” Most important was what he had learned about challenging himself.\nIt goes beyond what I had thought in the past, it goes beyond the idea of\n",
