Mahler, whose work was focused on child development, Otto F. Kernberg, an American professor of psychiatry and training analyst, bases his theoretical formulations on his extensive experience with severely disturbed adult patients. He is probably best known for his classic work, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism, which, as he explains in his preface to the book, is the result of \"thirteen years' effort to develop a concept of [the psychopathology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of borderline conditions] in the light of contemporary ego psychology and psychoanalytic object relations theory.\" As Greenberg and Mitchell explain, Kernberg \"derives most of his inferences from the transference reactions characteristically manifested [by such severely disturbed patients]\" (328).\nLike Mahler, Kernberg sees individual development as necessarily occurring in relation to others in the environment. Emphasizing the importance for the formation of identity of separating self and object images and \"integrating libidinally determined and aggressively determined self- and object-images\" in the early stages of life (162), Kernberg defines the self as \"an intrapsychic structure consisting of multiple self representations and their related affect dispositions.\" He explains that \"the normal self is integrated, in that its component self representations are dynamically organized into a comprehensive whole.\" This normal integrated self relates to \"integrated object representations, that is, to object representations which have incorporated the 'good' and 'bad' primitive object representations into integrative images of others in depth\" (315-16).\nWhen early self and object configurations are not successfully differentiated and integrated, severe disturbances result and persist into adulthood. Kernberg believes that what he calls the \"narcissistic personality,\" for example, has a pathological self-structure, originating in the second half of the oral stage, in which \"there is a fusion of ideal self, ideal object, and actual self images as a defense against an intolerable reality in the interpersonal realm\"; at the same time, \"unacceptable self images are repressed and projected onto external objects, which are devaluated\" (231-32). The narcissistic personality’s inflated self-concept thus consists of a confusion and distortion of self and parent images. Kernberg is not ",
