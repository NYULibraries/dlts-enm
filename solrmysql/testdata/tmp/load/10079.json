            "pageText": "the absence of . . . Yet a man can put himself there as a reader quite easily.” Keller adds, “She created the space for someone to understand her, enclose her, love her. . . . She lets one in lovingly” (70). Keller arrives at a conclusion of sorts when he remarks, “Hard for a man to see, I think, what is erotic about Emily Dickinson’s poetry [all of which he lumps together at this point]. Having slept with her once, I found it more masturbatory than anything else. Her art, I think, became a kind of orgasm withheld, though lusting still after the concealed and tantalizing, after the incomprehensible, after fantasy. She plays, but she does not climax with you” (72). By this point, Keller’s readers may wonder whose fantasies he is examining, Dickinson’s or his own.\nThe reader of Keller’s earlier commentary on Dickinson (1979) gets a better sense of what he means by describing her art as “masturbatory” when he discusses, together, the two poems quoted side by side on page 144.\nKeller argues, “Both phallic creatures are extremely attractive to her, even though she finds her genitals alarmed, feeling what she calls ‘tighter breathing/And Zero at the Bone’ in one case and ‘creeping blood’ in the other” (269). He sees her as both shocked and fascinated by the male erections, “aroused,” and even “penetrated” (“He fathomed me”). And yet, Keller goes on, “as much as she might desire it, she does not connect well, dismissing the encounter with the snake as merely a boy’s brief summertime adventure and the encounter with the worm snake as merely a housewife’s daydream. There is no significance in the sex; it is fun and games” (269). What he means by “fun and games” emerges more clearly when he remarks, “The sex in her poems forms no program but is made up of individual bold moments, flashes of desire, mainly masturbatory” (270). After quoting “Wild Nights!—Wild Nights!/Were I with thee/Wild Nights should be/Our luxury!” he adds, “She could play with it on wild nights in her poems without any consequences. It is, I believe, another of her areas of freedom” (271). Another instance of what he means he provides by quoting from #213: “Did the Harebell loose her girdle/To the lover Bee/Would the Bee the Harebell hallow/Much as formerly?” If I understand him, Keller cherishes the erotic playfulness he finds in some of Dickinson’s poems even as he limits his approbation because he feels the eroticism is “without any consequences,” only “fun and games.” His ambivalent epithet, “masturbatory,” expresses in nontechnical terms his reservations about his perception of inhibition in Dickinson’s eroticism.\n\n",
