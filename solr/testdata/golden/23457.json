            "pageText": "depicted visually as distinctly feminine. This kind of visual rendering combines with narrative story lines that produce characters who basically are desexualized.\nThe exception are the lesbian killers in Hunter. These characters are clearly not drawn in the timid fashion used with the other lesbians. They are at the opposite end of both the visual and the emotional spectrum. These women are obviously sexual. They dress in sophisticated, revealing clothes. (“The way she’s dressed,” says Hunter’s partner of Sgt. Foster, “she’s got herself a date.”) Of all the lesbian characters under discussion, these two are the only ones who are shown expressing their sexual passion for each other.

Marilyn, for example, agrees to her daughter’s demand that lover Patti stay away from the wedding. When she confesses that to her lover, Patti not only shows no anger or resentment but tells Marilyn that she should agree to whatever her daughter wants so as to seize this “golden moment.”\nAt another point in the show, Marilyn recounts what happened when she revealed her sexual identity to her husband several years earlier.
