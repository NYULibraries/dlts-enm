            "pageText": "Perhaps it is this location which has made [Dharavi] notoriously famous for the many steaming stills which produce the bootleg liquor which whets many a thirsty tongue in dry Bombay. (Lynch 1974, 1657)\n      \n      Dharavi’s illicit liquor trade and the extralegal acquisition and development of land and housing were closely linked in this period, with both activities supported by a clientelistic political party structure and emerging networks of organized crime groups.\n      Migration to the city increased rapidly in the aftermath of independence, placing even greater pressure on the city’s deteriorating housing stock and creating an opening for entrepreneurial criminal actors. The partition of India and Pakistan, and the violence that erupted in its wake, brought throngs of refugees and displaced persons to Bombay. Meanwhile, the newly formed national government had initiated a strategy of state-supported industrial development, and employment growth in Bombay’s factories was attracting workers from all over the country. The worker housing built before independence was woefully inadequate, yet still little new housing was being constructed by either the public or private sectors. Recognizing an opportunity, enterprising “slumlords” began subdividing open public and privately owned land and selling or renting out plots to new migrants. Paternalistic community leaders amassed considerable power in this manner by providing housing and basic services in Dharavi and the city’s other densely populated squatter settlements.\n      One entrepreneur who engaged in this type of land development in Dharavi was Varadarajan Mudaliar, known locally as Vardhabhai. In the 1950s Vardhabhai built a powerful criminal organization based on the illicit production and sale of alcohol in Dharavi. Before prohibition laws were enacted in Bombay in the late 1940s, alcohol had been produced legally—manufactured commercially and brewed traditionally by members of Dharavi’s Koli community. Once prohibition was enacted, commercial alcohol production ceased and the Kolis had a virtual monopoly in this area. Yet they would soon face competition as members of Dharavi’s Tamil community entered into the illicit alcohol trade (Sharma 2000). By the early 1960s a group of Tamil liquor producers had emerged as a powerful criminal force under the leadership of Vardhabhai. For over twenty years, Vardhabhai ran the city’s first and most powerful mafia organization out of Dharavi. Moving beyond liquor, Varadhabhai diversified his activities with land dealings and the establishment of gambling dens and brothels throughout the city. Reportedly a paternalistic community leader, Vardhabhai sponsored social and religious festivals and established informal governance structures in Dharavi.20\n      ",
