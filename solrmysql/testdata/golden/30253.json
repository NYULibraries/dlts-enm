            "pageText": "political conservatism or vacuity. A counterweight to this theoretical void might be taken from Jacques Rancière’s recent revision of the old questions of aesthetics and politics. For Rancière, “the political” does not reside in the “message” of a work of art, whether it is addressed to some repressive state or to some ossified intellectual tradition. Criticism that would look for social practice only in acts of exposure, parody, or satire does not take account of the social and institutional iniquities that sustain and are in turn sustained by artistic production; moreover, it would rely too heavily on the evidence of measurable intentions and outcomes. In its stead, Rancière offers an idea of dissent that is attuned to the specific relationships and limitations of art:\n\nArt and politics each define a form of dissensus, a dissensual re-configuration of the common experience of the sensible. If there is such a thing as an “aesthetics of politics,” it lies in a re-configuration of the distribution of the common through political processes of subjectivation. Correspondingly, if there is a politics of aesthetics, it lies in the practices and modes of visibility of art that re-configure the fabric of sensory experience.18\n\nArt can only function qua art to introduce new subjects and heterogeneous objects into the field of perception, to give expression to those populations denied legitimacy as speaking subjects, by stating egalitarian effects within the space of performances. Part of what makes art political, in other words, is its capacity to renovate what it is possible to perceive as political. Perhaps the most important question of this book, then, is not whether or how Shin Sang-ok signified politically as a filmmaker, but, rather, how an interrogation of his work can condition a reevaluation of how politics and art are constituted in postwar Korea.\nToward an adequate address of these problematics of postwar modernity, non-Western mass culture, and political aesthetics and, further, toward care for the instabilities of film and nation as fields of analysis, I have consciously moved Split Screen Korea in directions beyond the deep and complex groove laid down by Shin Sang-ok and his films. So while the chapters move through a rough chronological tracing of both the major phases of Shin’s career and the critical phenomena of postwar Korean culture, they each at the same time explore ideas, events, and conflicts that traverse the limits of the cinematic medium and trespass the borders of modern Korean history. The potential merits of this transdisciplinary, transnational mode of inquiry are clear: Shin Sang-ok’s wildly itinerant cinema is better served by a critical vision that takes account of contemporaneous developments ",
