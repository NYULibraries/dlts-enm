Briefly, the results confirm in essence the finding of Jay and Young’s self-selected sample (1979), and confirm the ideological prediction of Hypothesis 3: self-identified lesbians and gay men are very liberal indeed.\nWhen asked directly about their ideological leanings in the VRS survey, five gay/lesbian voters in nine call themselves liberals, as opposed to fewer than one in five nongay voters; and while more than one-third of nongay respondents call themselves conservatives, only one-eleventh of lesbian and gay respondents do so. Part of this is attributable to the strong feminism of an extraordinary percentage of the women: five lesbians in eight call themselves “strong feminists,” as opposed to a mere one in eight nongay women. However, even controlling for this factor and for the demographic correlates of gay/lesbian self-identification, homosexual self-identification in and of itself makes one statistically more likely to be liberal (see discussion under Hypothesis 6).\nPerhaps more interesting is the fact that, although the size of the localities in which they reside is a factor in the liberalism of gay men and lesbians, the percentages of liberals remain high and relatively even from the cities down to the countryside. Thus, city dwellers, both gay and straight, similarly tend to be liberal, with gay people tending to be somewhat more so; but in the suburbs, small towns, and rural areas, gay voters are far more liberal than their nongay neighbors.\nBecause the CBS form did not ask the respondents their ideology, I built a 0–6 scale, based on responses to six issue-related questions in which a liberal-conservative dichotomy reasonably could be established,11 with 6 being “most liberal,” 0 “most conservative.” Forty-six percent of gay and lesbian respondents fell into the two most “liberal” categories, versus 13 percent of heterosexuals; 24 percent of nongay voters, versus 8 percent of gay/lesbian voters, fell into the two most “conservative” categories.\nThis consistent liberalism, however, did not automatically translate into more support for the Democratic Party. The U.S.A. results find that only 12 percent more gay men and lesbians than nongay men and women identify with the Democrats (48 versus 36 percent). It does translate, however, into a general aversion to the Republican Party (19 percent of the gay sample versus 34 percent of the nongay sample reported a Republican affiliation). The rate of ",
