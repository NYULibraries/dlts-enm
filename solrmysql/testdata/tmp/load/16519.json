This suggests an ability to tolerate befuddlement, confusion and uncertainty. In other words, the patient should be “educable.” Naturally, patients who appreciate the arts and literature would have interested Freud specifically because he was personally interested in these subjects. But Freud never advocated “prerequisites” of this kind. He believed, however, that anyone who seeks analysis should be alive to inquiry. Unlike the contemporary university student, the educated person in Freud’s day wasn’t especially “technically” minded. He was more likely to be grounded in the humanities, an increasing rarity in our age.\nFreud advised against analyzing friends because it could jeopardize the transference. This advice, however, wasn’t always followed by Freud. Many of his patients became friends and supporters during their analysis or after. Many analysts today praise Freud for his advice on this matter but condemn his actual behavior. But there isn’t necessarily a contradiction between a “word of caution” on the one hand and expecting analysts to use their own judgment on the other. Freud had every right to experiment with his own rules and he did so all his life. It is remarkable how, if anything, Freud’s views on technique became more relaxed as he got older. This is true of other analysts as well. Perhaps age breeds a degree of confidence and even indulgence that youth mistrusts. Freud was conservative with his advice and knew that many analysts would feel uncomfortable getting too close to their patients. But Freud was socially active and very charismatic. It isn’t surprising that many of his patients were eager to support his ideas. Many of them continued to adore him after their analysis was over. Perhaps the more “unlovable” analysts are less likely to condone even a semblance of intimacy between themselves and their patients. But why should this become the standard for others to follow?\nWhat about patients who are especially eager to start their analysis? Freud warns against being overly impressed by enthusiastic patients. They won’t necessarily retain their enthusiasm as the analysis progresses, when they manifest resistances that, after all, are unconscious. One can never predict what form those resistances will assume or when they may appear. On the other hand, one shouldn’t be put off by patients who are initially skeptical and even mistrustful. Freud believed that an absence of trust was “only a symptom like other symptoms and it will not be an interference, ",
