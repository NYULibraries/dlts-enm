From a Marxist perspective, when the body is seen as a site of conflict at all, it is usually an extension of the proletariat in their struggle against capitalism, a struggle played out in the fields of labor. The conception of the gendered body as a social and symbolic construction embedded in social relations is itself a fairly recent one. Such a notion first became evident in texts informed by Critical Theory that incorporated the psychoanalytical paradigms of libido. One of the most prolific contributions in this area was, of course, Herbert Marcuse’s work on Eros and Civilization. More recent theoretical discourses have portrayed the body as a text inscribed with the effects of a postmodern “frenzy” of difference, displacement, and pastiche. The body is perhaps the most written about entity of postmodernist criticism, because the actual disintegration and unreflected simulation of real bodies through technology seems to have transformed flesh and blood into electronic bytes at the very moment that individuals are facing the hard reality of physical displacement, torture, hunger, and violence.\nAdelson’s book Making Bodies, Making Histories is refreshingly critical of theoretical approaches to the meaning of the human body that would obscure the interchange between the semiotic underpinnings of the body in discourse and its material reality in social constructions of identity. Adelson eloquently expresses the need to see bodies as locations and agents of resistance:\nA discussion of the mediation between bodies as material realities and bodies as discursive constructs must also acknowledge that the mediation may be further deflected by distinctions, contradictions, or tensions between interior and exterior spaces, neither of which in turn can be justifiably considered wholly private or thoroughly constructed. … That is to say, bodies constitute a nonontological, material ground for action at specific moments in time.
