This chapter has shown that learning itself is best thought of as a range of different practices, habits, values, and disciplines that lie at the heart of different class dispositions. On the whole, schools find it difficult to accommodate this kind of diversity, and so, as Basil Bernstein showed 25 years ago, they adopt a series of linguistic mechanisms to frame, classify, and categorize knowledge deliberately to maintain control and authority over “what counts as learning.”25 In some ways, the teacher just quoted is doing no more than rehearsing this process of marking out the boundaries of these knowledge realms. But if this is the case, how can we expect the new digital networked technologies to be able to operate in such a highly contested and jealously guarded series of domains?\nOver the year, we saw how this confusion between means (network technology) and forms of knowledge (how learning is understood differently in different places) repeatedly clashed and confused teachers, families, and the young people too. Nowhere did we see this more clearly than in the various fragile or halfhearted attempts to construct deliberate, and often too-simple, one-way digital linkages between home and school. For example, our fieldwork coincided with a new initiative to use email to strengthen communication between home and school. This failed, the teacher in charge explained to us, because although the school worried that parents were “hard to reach,” the teachers were “very nervous” that establishing email connection would unleash a flood of queries and demands from parents. In other instances, it was the students who resisted the intrusion of learning into their free time at home (for instance, when teachers set up subject blogs that they imagined the students would access out of school).26\nTo be sure, the school and the families were willing to cooperate on certain set-piece exchanges: weekly, via the paper planner that the students carried between school and home, transmitting notes, marks, or instructions as needed; annually, via Progress Day (the face-to-face parent-teacher consultation near the start of the year) and the end-of-year school report, itself heavily coded (see chapter 6); and on an ad hoc basis, when either teacher or parent had something directly to communicate to the other. But this did not mean either was open to further or more flexible forms of interchange. In the main, efforts to make connections were ineffective when conceptualized in ways that might extend ",
