Jefferson’s agriculturalism stemmed from the view that landed property particularly fostered independence, and Jefferson was not alone in a certain republican uneasiness about manufacturing and commercial forms of property.41 Commerce entailed mterdependence, since one manufacturer or trader had to depend on another, and another, and another; thus the property acquired from these interdependent activities was suspect, precisely because it was not autonomous. In a way, American agrarians were not so far removed from the medieval view that land was genuine and real, while money was merely transient, dependent, effiminate, and unsturdy.\nNotice as well that the republican vision of property was more or less indifferent to encouraging accumulation or aggregate wealth.
