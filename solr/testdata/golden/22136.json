            "pageText": "after hard work the judge develops a conviction about constitutionality that happens to oppose her beliefs about stage 1 goodness. For stage 2, what weight does constitutionality have in the balance of overall goodness in the two cases?\nIf the reasons to adhere to constitutionality are mainly deontological, the apparent decisiveness of legal arguments may not matter too much. There may be strong deontological reasons to follow one’s view of what is right even if one’s judgment is uncertain. If the reasons to adhere to constitutionality are overwhelmingly consequential, apparent decisiveness will make a tremendous difference. If everyone sees that a decision flaunts constitutionality, as in the first case, that may create a serious disturbance. But if, as in the second case, a result either way would be accepted by many as legitimate and attacked by many as a usurpation, the effect on stability and public legitimacy may be similar, however the court decides. These consequential considerations connected to constitutionality will not count for much against stage 1 goodness that points in the opposite direction.\nWhat is Smith’s view of this? He says that he is not concerned about the influence of his thesis on judicial behavior, but many readers are interested in the implications of what he writes for judges. When he addresses the values of constitutionality, Smith uses such phrases as “works real harm to the good that constitutionalism does.”7  His partially expressed theory is that the values of constitutionalism are consequential. But he does not address a corollary of this approach: that when the constitutional result is highly debatable, those values have comparatively little weight—as long as judges write opinions that make the results seem about as plausible as their competitors.8 \nIV. THE BREADTH OF THE PROBLEM\nI turn now to my objections to the manner in which Smith poses his problem. In his chapter, he treats constitutionality and the Supreme Court as if they are discrete, isolable aspects of the U.S. legal system, rather than parts of a much larger set of rules, principles, and institutions. Much more troubling for his thesis is that his standard of constitutionality is absurd—not remotely close to what the standard of constitutionality is, and should be, ",
