She wears her hair neatly pulled back, revealing her determined expression. Her work places her in the global public sphere, allowing her to imagine and experience new friends and a sense of global belonging. She reiterates Avantika’s sense that call center labor has helped her develop “more confidence.” “I have changed a lot,” she explains. “I’m a very shy person, no, reserved [pause]. I don’t know. You could call me an introvert. I’m not an outgoing type of a person. I have changed. I have more confidence. More friends. [My] otherwise small world has now opened up” (BigBank, personal interview, 2004). As with Avantika’s account, call center labor recasts Roshan’s sense of self, both affectively and spatially. Her self-account moves from an interior subject (she describes herself as a “shy person” and an “introvert”) to a relationally oriented subject (she has both “more confidence,” and, it follows, “more friends”). She then casts this relational unfolding onto an expansive spatial register, concluding that her “small world has now opened up.”\nAvantika and Roshan’s comments provide insights into the gendered aspects of call center labor. Patel argues that while women’s participation in call center labor provides new forms of independence as they gain access to previously inaccessible night spaces, their mobility is also hampered by the need for a male escort to ensure physical safety and to ameliorate the perception that such women are “too bold.” While Avantika and Roshan use the same language to describe their growth as call center workers, their sense of being bold has a positive valence: their labor has empowered them by making them “bold in interacting.” Patel (2010) acknowledges that the gendered dynamics of call center labor are vexed. She notes that while “call center employment is associated with modernization, it also intersects with a woman’s worth in ways that conflict with and degrade their bodily value in spaces deemed traditional, such as arranged marriage” (12). This tension seems to play out for Avantika and Roshan. On one hand, they describe how their capacity to speak with global others provides a sense of virtual mobility that emboldens them both in local spaces and interpersonal relations. Yet Avantika consistently complains, as we saw in the previous chapter, that call center labor undermines her relationship with her husband and family members. So while the global sense of mobility might give female agents an affirming sense of increased boldness, it also places them in a vexed relationship to tradition. For instance, Patel sees women’s ",
