            "pageText": "potential through play—is also a powerful means of coming to understand our evolving society, in which (often hidden) software models structure much of how we live now.”5 Without overlooking key differences in their media-specific print as opposed to computationally based methods of understanding “fictional worlds as systems,” and in their modes of fictional play with these systems processes (with the exception of Patchwork Girl), it is nevertheless worth noting the underlying similarities in some of their digital literary approaches and aims.\nIn elaborating on these texts’ experimental technics, their creative reengagements with emergent digital practices and social systems, I want to join in their wager that we can, in this intently differential way, come to understand how digital cultures work and find new resources for social, cultural, and political life well suited to these emerging contexts. Exploring technics across the supposed print/digital divide, these literary texts clearly refuse the positioning of literary print cultures outside or in opposition to U.S. digital cultures. More importantly, their comparative media practices proceed to register through their expressive processes, and to reflect on, digital cultures’ inclination and capacities to re- and dematerialize defining elements of our biological, economic, cultural, and social lives. They begin to come to terms with the fact that in contemporary late capitalism “the world of things has become a world of signs—a universe that both brings into being and is brought into being by symbolic codes.”6 Writer Steve Tomasula suggests that “perhaps it is for this reason alone that that most symbolic of all codes, the literary text, can foreshadow a future world while the contemporary world suggests the future of poetics.”7 He remarks on the reciprocal interplay between literary text and extraliterary world that now involves the literary’s anticipation of the significantly symbolic operations of the real world of finance capital and futures trading while the real world of things seems on the verge of outmaneuvering the poetic in the creativity, dynamism, and affective power of its symbolic, world-building maneuvers. At the core of these influential relays between the literary and its environments is this broader intertwining and interplay between symbolic and material processes today that confounds previous, oppositional understandings of the symbolic and material (and the cultural and economic spheres with which they are respectively aligned).\nIn this context, comparative media practices, involved in a similar transposition of symbolic practices from one medium to another, or a transposition that engages the material preconditions of digital or print media to divergent symbolic, expressive ends, can be understood as a poetic method ",
