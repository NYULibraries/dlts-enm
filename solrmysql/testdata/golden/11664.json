What differentiates Judaism from other faiths is that it alone has attained a pure concept of God, recognizing him in all his universality. Of course, Judaism never presented its Weltanschauung in philosophical terminology, and thus the sublime truths of Judaism often go unrecognized. To remedy this situation, modern Jews require a guide which will engage in the method of interpretation outlined in the second chapter of the Guide, by which philosophical Ideen can be derived from the Vorstellungen and Begriffe which are the medium of religious expression.\n40. For further discussion of this, see next chapter.\n41. Cf. the recent article by Binyamin Ish-Shalom, “Ha-Mitzvot uma’amdan b’filosofia ha-datit shel R. Nachman Krochmal,” Tarbiz, vol. 56 (1987), pp. 373-83, passim.\n42. Of course, Krochmal’s battle is not really with anthropomorphisms; that battle had already been fought by Maimonides. (See Moreh, pt. 1, passim; for Maimonides’ discussion of the terms dibbur and amirah, see Moreh, 1:65.) Rather, Krochmal is concerned to show that God’s revelation is both possible and necessary by his very nature; under such circumstances, the philosopher could not possibly deny it.\n43. This raises the issue of a cessation of prophecy, which Jewish tradition demands. Krochmal accepts that classical prophecy did in fact cease, although, he maintains, it continued a bit longer than is generally supposed (see below, chapter 4). It must be noted that according to tradition (and Krochmal) prophecy came to an end in the period in which Jews had finally achieved a clear recognition of God as absolute spirit. Given the partnership between God and humans, specifically Israel (see immediately below in the text), the recognition of God as absolute spirit may have obviated the need for God to communicate with Israel through prophecy. Rather, the onus of responsibility now turns to Israel to bring the rest of the world to consciousness of God as absolute spirit (Guide, p. 37). On all this, see immediately below in the text and chapter 3, passim.\n44. One will note the similarity between this presentation and two of the central claims of Lurianic kabbalah, namely its doctrines of tsimtsum and tiqqun. While obviously admiring the view that stands behind these doctrines, the Lurianic materials are far too mythological for ",
