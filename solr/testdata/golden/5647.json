Their breathless descriptions of opportunities to both express one's individual style and practice self-guidance bring to light the highly American nature of skateboarding. The related desire for a sense of freedom is also highly American, but the ways in which skateboarders describe a feeling of bodily transcendence reveal a particular experience of freedom that lies outside traditional white male rationality. The skaters' correspondence with mainstream American culture is complex in its various assessments of mainstream codes. The values and ideologies central to skateboarding culture blur the boundaries between subculture and mainstream and reveal that, while masculinity may operate as what I call a “location of difference” for skateboarding culture, other ideologies—such as freedom and individuality—lie firmly within mainstream America.\n“It's just you and your board”: Individuality and Self-Expression\nIn sharp contrast to their sometimes adamant rejection of the norms of traditional sports, many skateboarders wax poetic about the expressive and individualistic nature of skateboarding. Responding to the question, “Why do you skate?” with descriptions of their love of the practice, skateboarders usually shifted tone and stared into space, grappling for words that would describe the joy of the experience. Far from the overly aggressive, in-your-face skateboarders on mainstream television, these boys spoke quietly and passionately of their devotion to skating.\nIt's just you and your board…. It's like an art form in a sense. The only limitations you have in skateboarding [are] your own. And the idea that you can just take a thought, a pure idea, a thought in your head and go attempt to do it, it's kind of like art. (Jeremiah, age 22)\n",
