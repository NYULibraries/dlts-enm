To be mentally retarded is to be inferior.\nThe label, sadly, makes that inferiority increasingly “real.” Through the complex interactions between the society and the labeled person, the “mentally retarded” person appears “retarded” and, increasingly, tailors her behavior to accommodate the expectations of her social environment. The opportunities afforded her in that environment become increasingly limited, and so too her achievements, and on and on it goes, in a relentless, self-perpetuating cycle. And it all started with an IQ test.\nMental retardation, in the end, is not so much a product of creation, as it is a product of human re-creation. People are created as just plain people; we make them “mentally retarded” just because they need to be labeled that way for one political reason or another.\nAnd it is politics, and politics alone, that causes people to “suffer from” mental retardation.\nThe same applies to other forms of “disability.” The World Health Organization makes this plain with its operative definitions: it defines “impairment” as “an abnormality or loss of any physiological or anatomical structure or function”; “disability” as “the consequences of an impairment”; and “handicap” as “the social disadvantage that results from an impairment or disability.” Impairments, then, may be products of creation, but they are not “disabilities” until we experience them as such, and even then, it is a socio-political decision to “handicap” people due to their impairments.4\nI am color-blind. It is an impairment. It is not a disability, except on the mornings that I am forced to dress myself. Even then, however, it is not a handicap, except to the extent that I need to appeal to a fashion-conscious crowd (which is, thankfully, never). It would be a handicap, however, if I was a clothes salesman, or a house painter, or an interior decorator, and so on—at least it would be if my customers lived in a color-coordinated society and were bent on upholding its conventions. But it is ultimately the cultural context that is important: only it can handicap me because of who I am.\nGender is also constructed. Of course, people are created as biological males and females, but that has very little significance except in a cultural context. There is, to illustrate, an ongoing and highly visible ",
