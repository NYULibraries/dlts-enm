            "pageText": "Ultimately, however, my respondents were drawn to DJing by the music, power, and energy of DJ culture as well as the creative possibilities it affords. A number of them point to a “feeling,” “vibe,” or “rush” unique to DJ culture that comes from eliciting a strong, positive response from the crowd. This involves the build-up and subsequent release of tension through the careful selection of records, what one author has described as “peaks” within the context of underground dance music.31\n\nONE TYME: It’s like, I got a gig, I’m rocking the party, and it’s like the crowd is just feeling your vibe and they’re singing every lyric to the song you’re playing. And they’re like responding to you, not even having an MC. They’re screaming when the first break comes on and they’re like “Yeah.” It’s like that feeling is the best feeling in the world. I could never get it anywhere else.32\nTEASE: The biggest rush that you could get as a DJ, or the biggest satisfaction is, like, looking at the crowd having fun, me spinning at a club, when you get a crowd response from a record, it’s like the best thing. It’s like, “Wow, I’m making these people happy. Who am I? I’m just a little nobody.” But honestly, in reality, you being a DJ, regardless of male or female, it’s your job to make them happy. You don’t play what you want to hear. I mean it’s cool and it’s your own taste in fashion, but being a DJ, your job is to play what they want to hear.33\n\nBut being a good DJ is not just about playing what the crowd wants but also knowing what to play at just the right moment. Rygar explains:\n\nRYGAR: The crowd, what they know is the transitions that a DJ makes. Like, if they’re clean, like you basically want to make the transition smooth so that the crowd won’t be like, “Oh, what just happened,” you know. So that and playing what the crowd wants, playing the song after another, you know, not playing all hype songs at the same time but keeping a good balance so you could eventually peak at the end of the party it will be so high that it will end and [the crowd] be like, “Damn, that was fun,” you know.34\n\nFor my respondents, then, much of the appeal of DJing stems from being in a position to move the crowd and generate a feeling or vibe they do not get elsewhere. It enables them to exercise agency and control in a way that is foreclosed in other spheres of their lives.\nIn Rey-Jun’s case, he got into DJing in the late 1980s, a time when the mobile DJ scene was in decline, but also when turntablism was just beginning to emerge. This transition is significant because it changed Rey-Jun’s perception of what it means to be a DJ:\n\nINTERVIEWER: You mentioned how an emphasis on the skills got you into DJing even more. Can you talk more about that?\n",
