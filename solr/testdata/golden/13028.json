            "pageText": "the Supreme Court’s opinions in the perilous 1790s is their political effectiveness in persuasively upholding the power, authority, and respect of the shaky new national government while exciting no dismembering dissent; and the proper gauges of its members are their courage and consistency in supporting the new Constitution and its constituted government. On both of these measures, the amiable, safe, conscientious Virginian John Blair ranks at the top.\nIndeed, Blair was a “safe and conscientious” supporter of his class. The Revolutionary alliance between the merchants of the North and the planters of the South, embodied in the developmental and planter interests of the first president, was still fluid and viable in the 1790s, though it was breaking down and would not remain so for long. (Most supporters of the mercantile interest were still natural lawyers, like Blair, but the tendency would be for them to adopt the emerging positivist theory of law.) Blair, who also personified both sorts of interest, apparently (like most contemporaries) without seeing their incompatibility, emphasized solidarity with the developmental and mercantile interests of the Jay/Hamilton Federalists in his opinions, consistently upholding the might and, with regard to punishment of the whiskey rebels, the economic schemes of their new national government. Thanks to the qualities and circumstances just mentioned, his divergence from the planting interest also did not bring him criticism.\nEulogizers recalled Blair’s mildness, gravity, and piety, his own absence of fanaticism, and the lack of any assault upon him by an enemy. St. George Tucker, one of the leading Virginia lawyers of the next generation, remembered him as quiet, dull, and gentlemanly.62 Though not a strong thinker as a jurist, John Blair did have an ability to get to the heart of the matter, was an able and competent judge, and was, first and foremost, sturdily devoted to his own interests and to the cause of mercantile and planter republican independence, as later embodied in the Federalist Party.\nNOTES\n1.
