            "pageText": "anarchistic and destructive attitudes and their anti-Jewish activity is evident in many of his works, including his first programmatic essay, “Redemption Through Sin.” His interest in Dobrushka’s career is purely the consequence of a deep satisfaction gained from the study of hundreds of documents in half a dozen languages. There is no identification with the “hero,” and certainly no inclination to embrace his political or theological views, nor is there any ethical acceptance of his bizarre actions.\nIt is sometimes stated that Scholem was interested in the heretical, anarchistic movements among Jewish mystics, thus revealing his own tendencies. This does not have any basis in the facts. Scholem did not dedicate more energy and interest to the Frankist movement, for instance, than to the rather conservative and moderate circle of kabbalists in Gerona (northern Spain) in the first half of the thirteenth century. He did not dedicate more space or time to the study of the Sabbatian movement than he did to the book Bahir and the early kabbalah. Why, therefore, this persistent impression, found in so many descriptions of Scholem’s outlook?\nThe answer is rather simple. This impression is not based on what Scholem actually did, but on what his readers preferred to study. Few people read his books on the early kabbalah, while his studies on Sabbatianism and Frankism have, since the 1950s, become part of Israeli culture. The questions, therefore, should not be directed toward Scholem, but rather toward our generation: Why are we so interested in the anarchic and unorthodox in the Jewish past? Is it because we feel ourselves to be, in relation to our forefathers, anarchistic ",
