            "pageText": "\n characters rise not only from our imaginations, but also from our own experiences and needs. Bernard Arnold, a new member of the Western Wayne Players, was interviewed during the formation of Brothers (1999). Someone asked his character to talk about his relation to his father. Bernard began to answer, then paused, stunned, and declared, “This is real!” The others laughed and said, “Welcome to the Western Wayne Players!” When an actor becomes aware of this dimension, the play takes on increased urgency.\nAfter several weeks, we begin to bring a list of the scenes developed so far. We describe each scene, sometimes with a few pieces of dialogue we wish to remember. This is as much text as we have, and the scenes continue to be improvised as we rehearse them. The actors review the scene before they go on stage and are generally true to it, but improvisation continues into the performance itself, sometimes bringing new comedy, new emotion and power.11\nAnd the plays, at their best, lead, like most plays, from disrupted communities and individual conflicts to adjustments, resolutions, and a sophisticated reestablishment of balance. The plot of The Genie and the Hood (June 1999) has the thousand-year-old Dr. Krasenknopf and his somewhat younger genie, Hasan, opening a ghetto pawnshop. Their even younger accomplice is fine as long as she is kept in alcohol. When three men see the magic lamp in the window, they enter and touch the lamp. A gong sounds and Hasan appears (speaking in rhyme) and offers them three wishes. He and Dr. Krasenknopf then use their wishes to divide and destroy the ghetto. Eventually some women, including the accomplice (the evil pair have mistakenly let the community go dry), figure out what is happening and they realize that they can defeat Dr. Krasenknopf and Hasan with the power of women's laughter. They teach it to others and march on the pawnshop. Krasenknopf and Hasan, defiant and nearly victorious at first, melt to nothing. The community has resisted, come together, learned and asserted new values. However, while this is at least a temporary victory for the community, the final scene shows Krasenknopf and Hasan standing in their new pawnshop in Kansas City, Missouri, as townspeople peer in at the lamp. The struggle continues elsewhere and always.\nTHE ROLES OF THE UNIVERSITY FACILITATORS\nAlthough we usually come from some degree of affluence and academic success, although most of us are white and female, although at the end of every\n",
