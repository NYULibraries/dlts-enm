Quite a few refugees admitted that they had derived false impressions based on the movies or on writers like Upton Sinclair (or, on a more vulgar level, the cowboy stories of Karl May). They had expected to see Indians in full headdress and Chicago gangsters everywhere, and had thought that all of America looked like lower Manhattan.
