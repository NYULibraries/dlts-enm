            "pageText": "and wait for the day when they would have a child together.\nAs Vera wiped the Mr. Muscle from the walls with a scrubbrush, Thomas eagerly reread the stack of religious articles which he had torn from the scrapbooks, waiting for inspiration.\nHe finally settled on an article about the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Manhattan, which a New York playwright and self-proclaimed priest named Bob Labar had made famous. In the church, Thomas read, Bob Labar conducted services in which the parishioners were blindfolded and forced to kneel at the altar for an hour in four inches of bread crumbs, then were ushered into a tiny bathroom for the environmental confession, where a smiling man wearing a wreath of toilet paper flushed away their sins—one flush for each venial sin and three flushes for each mortal sin.\nThomas tried to imagine himself attending services at the church, then shaking hands with Bob Labar, but he could not. He couldn’t even remember any longer what the oily man looked like or what he represented. The articles he had just read, which once would have inspired hours of imaginative thought, were now merely words to him. His imagination failed him.\nFinally, he reread the article on the Holy Patch under the light of the new pink bulb. He read that Christ had 125 welts on his body when he died. He tried repeatedly to connect his life to the number 125, but could not. He couldn’t even remember the sight-cryptogram he had once assigned to the Patch. He could imagine nothing but darkness. Utter darkness, without colors or sound or space.\nMeanwhile, Vera knelt next to him on the floor of the coal bin and scrubbed it with Old English Furniture Polish, watching Thomas’s face lovingly.\n",
