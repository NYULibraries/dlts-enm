The language the child learns always embodies various social and cultural fictions. These fictions operate as children learn both “what is,” and also who they are expected to be. In learning these things, children exclude certain possibilities from their development. Schwab observes that as the child develops,\neverything must be excluded that does not comply with the norms transmitted by others, of the symbolic order of society. Only by way of exclusions can the subject become what he is to be; but they separate him from essential parts of his self.”58\nAs the ego develops, it excludes from itself possible images of self-definition. But it also excludes something more—certain aspects of reality and certain possibilities for its own growth and satisfaction that will not “fit” into the system that dominates the method of self-definition.\nSuch exclusion can cause problems at later stages of life, and it is here that primary processes can be helpful. Repressed unfulfilled satisfactions continually exert pressure on language and perception through primary processes. In many cases such pressure distorts perception of the “real.” But in other cases, when the real is under exclusion or repression already, primary processes can serve to reintegrate aspects of the real into the domain of language and consciousness. Because the self wants what it lacks, primary process thinking points to a lack that language and the self have not yet named. Under these conditions, as Schwab argues, language can serve in “expressing or even communicating what is excluded from the symbolic order.”59 Primary processes produce new signifieds by deforming and reforming signifiers. In this manner primary processes, seeking to name an absent lack, can generate categories of perception that help to name or visualize aspects of reality hitherto excluded from representation.\nLacan and other recent theorists encourage us to remember that when we consider the function of language in expressing “what is excluded from the symbolic order” (expressing knowledge of the real excluded from consciousness), we must be careful about our terms. We often confuse what we understand as reality, which is really an inner map we have constructed, with the “Real.” The Real is not available for direct perception or linguistic reference. It is in Jameson’s sense an absent ",
