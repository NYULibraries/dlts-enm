A 1991 case in Berlin recognized that a woman’s work as a prostitute is a legitimate occupational activity and that therefore she is to be awarded financial assistance for retraining.10 In other words, only when sexual exploitation is regulated and thereby guaranteed to the consumer market can women claim compensation for getting out of it.\nState regulation has not eliminated pimps. Rather, it offers them legal cover. It has facilitated trafficking of Asian women, particularly from Thailand to Germany and the Netherlands. The trafficking syndicate appears to have been taken over in part by some procurers connected with the thriving sex industry in Germany. According to a report in Der Spiegel in December 1977, the largest ring of procurers ever found in Germany was broken up when 11 men and 1 woman from Argentina and Uruguay were arrested for procuring women from those countries and bringing them to Frankfurt, where they were put into prostitution on the street as well as in eros centers. Authorities became suspicious when they observed that a large number of prostitutes in the Frankfurt area were not from Germany but were instead from South American countries. After the arrest of 50 prostitutes in a large raid, information on the gang came to light. According to the report, so many women were procured that if a woman escaped or ran away from the gang, they never bothered to go after her because they were able to replace her immediately. The prostitutes who were brought in from Argentina and Uruguay worked for three months on tourist visas and then were taken to Italy, where they were married to unemployed or retired Italian men who were paid $1,000 for the marriage. Italian marriage made the women members of the European Common Market and therefore able to return to Germany to continue their work.\nIt was with the boom of the German eros centers in the mid-1960s that Austrian pimps started to move into the German scene, ",
