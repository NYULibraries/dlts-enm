            "pageText": "in fact those of the student movement itself. This combination of striking physical force and shrewd rhetorical manipulation helped the coup leaders consolidate their power with a population that was, on the one hand, aching for broad social transformation, and on the other, wearied from the upheavals of the postliberation/postwar decades.\nIf the discursive field in this period was unstable and fraught with ideological ambiguity, the material transformations enacted through the ambitious and often brutal planning of the SNRC presented a clear and palpable sign of a radically changed Korean society. Under various slogans such as “Korea first, economy first,” or “Construction on the one hand, national defense on the other,” the push for national reconstruction touched virtually every area of life in the country, from the reorganization of the public education system and realignments in the banking sector to reform of laws governing land ownership and corporate governance. While in some ways the terms of the first five-year economic plan were not as oppressive as the controls that would be instituted in the 1970s, the effect they had on people’s lives was certainly more sudden and sweeping. And while much of the planning focused, as it would throughout the next two decades of the administration, on the industrial sector, its vision for a strengthened agricultural economy and rapid urbanization fundamentally altered realities in rural areas where, as late as 1963, 80 percent of the population lived. But even here the line separating the April from the May revolution was sometimes blurry. For, within the overarching “Patriotic National Reconstruction Movement,” the overarching program of the SCNR, sprang the “People’s Reconstruction Movement” (kungmin chaegŏn undong), a relatively short-lived campaign that sought to build democracy from the bottom up through a number of rural programs that emphasized adult literacy, mutual aid for community projects, and even hygiene. Sent out under the slogan, “Let us attain revolutionary tasks with our own hands,” the largely educated youth who were the “vanguards” of the campaign worked closely with local governments to initiate their tasks. While within a few years the movement hardened to eventually form the highly bureaucratic Office of Rural Development, its early goals and methods merged unmistakably with those of the “native land development” campaigns of the 4.19 radicals and their vnarod project. Further, both of these movements themselves echoed similar initiatives taken decades earlier by elite urban intellectuals who, in the aftermath of the March First Independence Movement, returned to their rural hometowns to bring enlightenment and civilization, as well as political empowerment.\n",
