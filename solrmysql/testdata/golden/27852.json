These guidelines had the potential to make not only passionate motherlove but also undue intensity in love of all sorts an embarrassing reminder of infancy.\nDuring the 1930s researchers developed the basis for a somewhat more positive approach to mothers. The British psychoanalyst Winnicott, for example, argued for a concept of “good enough mothering,” assuring women that most of them could summon up enough affection to get their job done. The concept affirmed the importance of maternal competency and acknowledged an emotional component, but it hardly revived Victorian awe at the powers of motherlove; indeed, it seemed consciously to admit the loss of this culture and to compensate by accepting a much more moderate, even prosaic emotional base as adequate.51\nFrom this make-do approach, in turn, beginning with Dr. Spock in 1945, childrearing manuals became a bit more consistently supportive of parental love, urging mothers in particular to have confidence in their emotions. The message reflected the pervasive concern about excess but confirmed babies’ need for “gentle and loving” treatment. “Children need to have family affection, loyalty, and love behind them in order that they may grow into self-sustaining, self-respecting persons.” While acknowledging love, this new tone reflected the distance from real Victorianism. Fathers were included with mothers with regard to parental emotion; there was nothing very special about maternalism. “Affection” increasingly replaced “love” as the principal noun, and references to affection were frequently combined with injunctions about common sense, harmony, and other virtues—the emotion itself was not singled out, nor was it considered transcendent. As an adoption book noted, “A confident, serene love is what he [the adoptive child] needs and what you will give him. Not suffocating love, not blind, sacrificial love that wipes out your own identity.”52\nThus, despite a bit more support for motherlove after the 1940s, the cautions persisted in full force—though now they could be mentioned only in passing because the basic standards seemed so well established. Thus the mother and child relationship was “often too intense and precarious,” according to a 1952. manual. Or according to a 1970 book, echoing Watson, “Mothers, particularly, rely heavily on their children to give them satisfactions and pleasures that more appropriately should come from the marriage relationship.”53 Under “Emotional Growing ",
