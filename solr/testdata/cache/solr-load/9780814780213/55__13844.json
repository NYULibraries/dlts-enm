            "pageText": "When the Morita-Ishihara book first created a stir in the United States, Japanese misunderstood what the fuss was about and jumped to the conclusion that Americans were reacting to the book’s title. This provoked a backlash in the opposite direction. What was so wrong, Japanese asked, about Japan saying “no”? Does America have the right to expect Japan to do everything its way? What had upset America, however, was not the possibility that Japan might say “no.” In fact, the United States would greatly welcome a clear “yes” or “no” from Japan, instead of the vague, noncommittal responses that Japanese officials are all too prone to make. A good case in point was the U.S.–Japan agreement in August 1991 to increase the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market to 20 percent by the end of 1992. When the goal was not reached by that date (it was, in fact, achieved in March 1993), the Japanese side responded that the 20-percent figure had been a target at which to aim, not a goal that they were committed to fulfill. This inability or unwillingness to give a definite answer has created a climate in which misunderstanding thrives and has driven America to complain that negotiating with Japan is somewhat akin to peeling an onion—responses are always piecemeal and one obstacle follows another ad infinitum. When Japan means “no” it should say “no,” and when it means “yes” it should say “yes.” America would have no serious objections to that.\nThe problem lies in what Japan might say “no” to. On issues related to America’s national defense and security, Japanese should be very cautious about even hinting, as Shintaro Ishihara did, that Japan might bypass the United States and enter into friendly relations ",
