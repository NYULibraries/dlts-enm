Although commonly associated with near-future forms of technological augmentation— cybernetics, genetic engineering, mind–computer interfacing, and so on—posthumanism is best understood as a broader, transhistorical attempt to integrate the human into larger networks of being (it is this emphasis on positive integration that differentiates posthumanism from antihumanism’s negative or deconstructive critique, evident in early Foucault, Lyotard, and Derrida).4 By this definition, posthumanism encompasses not only technoscientific transhumanism (e.g., the initial porting of Jake’s mind into the artificially manufactured Na’vi body) but also older, romantic forms of incorporation into natural environments (e.g., the Na’vi ability to connect psychically with Pandora’s sentient flora and fauna via the symbiotic neural interfaces in their ponytails).5 In both instances, Jake is made more than himself by abandoning himself, by escaping the boundedness of his human incarnation.\n        This flight into the more-than-human is Avatar’s answer to the villainous Resources Development Administration (RDA), whose ravaging of Pandora is rooted, the film suggests, in a cosmology that deems humanity to be ontologically distinct from and superior to the nonhuman world.6 Agent of progress, rationality, and order, the RDA regards Pandora as mere chaotic stuff, raw material to be refined unto obliteration. The RDA, that is, exemplifies all of the humanist inhumanities so frequently laid at the feet of the Renaissance and Enlightenment philosophical tradition—which makes Jake, as demonstrated by his overcoming of this tradition’s mind–body, human–nonhuman, and self–environment dualisms, its posthumanist correction.\n        And yet there is in Avatar, as in much posthumanism more generally, an uncanny reminder or remainder of the very humanism it attempts to supplant.7 Jake’s transformation from human disability to posthuman ability, for instance, intensifies rather than departs from humanism’s belief in progressive perfectibility: his physical and cognitive capacities heightened, his individual agency amplified, his life extended—all confirming N. Katherine Hayles’s charge that transhumanism merely “expand[s] [the] prerogatives” of the “autonomous liberal subject . . . into the realm of the posthuman.”8 His assimilation into the Pandoran ecology results not, as Bruno Latour claims, ",
