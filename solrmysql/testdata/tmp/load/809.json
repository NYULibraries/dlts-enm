Too often the bloggers' realm is a closed circle of online friends speaking to one another. Some of the coarsest but most insightful exchanges regarding race and class in New Orleans are found in the work of neither the bloggers nor the Picayune's print journalists but in the raw, often racialized comments posted by citizens throughout the various nola.com forums.17\nDocumenting the Documentary Impulse\nNot since the Great Depression has the impulse to document recent history been as evident and widespread as along the Gulf Coast in the years following Katrina. Arguably, not even 9/11 generated as much documentary interest. Oral history projects, documentary films, social science and hard science research studies, Web sites, commercially published and self-published books, blogs, and ceaseless media coverage are only some of the efforts that allow people to tell their stories. Before the flooding, far fewer outsiders expressed interest in the history and well-being of New Orleans. Following Katrina, disaster researchers, various media workers, and many others began to inundate New Orleans, mining the city for purposes that may simultaneously be selfless and self-serving. Newcomers and natives share the desire to document New Orleans' man-made tragedy as well as the natural disasters that devastated vast areas east and west of the city.\nIronically, those Louisiana and Mississippi public historians, oral historians, and anthropologists best prepared to document the effects of Katrina on the communities they have been working with for decades are too often on the periphery. Their carefully planned, regionwide oral history proposal went unfunded. Meanwhile, arts organizations whose interviewers have limited backgrounds in oral history are much more likely to have been funded. For example, arts groups accustomed to using oral history as their primary source for interpreting the culture of a neighborhood or other group have been anointed by their funding agencies to document for the sake of posterity rather than performance. Several of the professional oral historians in the region are resigned to the situation when they should be collaborating with the newcomers.18\nWhile the arts organizations recognize the importance of oral history interviews, FEMA deliberately sought to avoid the difficulty of including “the human element” among its documentation efforts.
