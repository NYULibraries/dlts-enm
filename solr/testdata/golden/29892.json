Curious about the mechanisms of Dharavi’s ward-level politics, I asked how he learns of his constituents’ concerns. Do they seek him out to discuss these space issues? And does he then bring these concerns directly to officials in the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), the government agency charged with designing the plan? He replied emphatically that yes, his constituents come to him to discuss these and all manner of issues. But he quickly clarified that there is little point in raising them with the SRA, as they would not be addressed in the planning process. “Mukesh Mehta and the SRA will not change the plan. They are making all the decisions themselves.” He further explained that, as a ward councilor, he has little say in “how the city gets run.” The city is run by Maharashtra’s chief minister, he explained, and local politicians are not very involved. Sheynde seemed more or less resigned to the limited influence he had over the DRP and in municipal affairs more generally. But as was evident by the brazen way he spoke about the project, as well as by the entourage that accompanied him, Sheynde clearly commanded respect within Dharavi, and there were domains over which he had influence.\n      While Sheynde’s candor and vocal opposition were distinctive, his characterization of a centralized planning process for the DRP was widespread. Working closely with the SRA and the state’s chief minister, Mehta appeared to have consolidated the authority and resources required for Dharavi’s redevelopment. The concerns Sheynde raised had an urgency to them because he believed implementation was imminent. This belief that development was finally coming to Dharavi was pervasive among the project’s advocates and its critics. What development would mean for the settlement’s hundreds of thousands of residents and productive industries was unclear and subject to fierce negotiations. But something was happening. In addition to an altered political context and new economies of land and property, the DRP appeared to have something that earlier development schemes in Dharavi and elsewhere had lacked: centralized authority. Since its early conceptualization in the late 1990s, Mehta had advocated for the project in the face of bureaucratic neglect and political opposition. When the state endorsed the project in early 2004, Mehta received the ",
