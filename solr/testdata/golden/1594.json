            "pageText": "\nOne key problem facing Zhao Qizheng and his colleagues was the need to find an overarching concept to define China's approach to the world and to puncture talk in certain Western quarters of the Chinese threat. He found his answer in the term peaceful rise (heping jueqi), a phrase coined by thinker Zheng Bijian in 2003 and swiftly embraced by the Beijing government. The term was not ideal for translation—as China-watcher Joshua Cooper Ramo has noted, its coining sparked a brief debate over whether the concept of jueqi was best rendered as “surge” or “emergence,” while the ideogram for the first part of the word suggested an earthquake—but peaceful rise stuck (Ramo 2007; Zheng 2005). By 2007 it had nevertheless been largely displaced by discourse focused not so much on China as on the international context it wished to promote: the concept of “building a harmonious world” (Li and Wang 2007).\nThe core of Chinese public diplomacy lies in deeds rather than words. China has developed a keen eye for prestige events and showpiece policy initiatives. One such event was the launch in October 2003 of China's first manned space flight. The achievement certainly played well at home—the primary audience—and in many locations overseas, although as Times of India noted, the launch used essentially forty-year-old technology. Its editorial dubbed the flight the “Great Creep Forward” (Banke 2003). More significantly China has launched major international aid and development initiatives, all couched in the rhetoric of “win-win” cooperation. China has already delivered much to Latin America, the Middle East, and most especially Africa, but claims to need nothing in return (Kurlantzick 2007, 44). It has been swift to build links with nations that are isolated from Western diplomacy. Its policy of “nonintervention” has enabled partnerships with Iran, Venezuela, and even Zimbabwe. And, in the last case, Chinese aid has included instruction in how effectively to jam opposition radio signals (BBC Monitoring 2006.) Despite the enmity these activities have sparked in the west, they have also played a role in advancing the country's international reputation, as have China's efforts to take a leadership role in the diplomacy around North Korean nuclear weapons (Shirk 2006).\nPolicies need to be publicized to have an impact, and Zhao Qizheng was swift to move to maximize their reach. Zhao, his colleagues and successors launched initiatives across the range of the five activities that characterize classic public diplomacy practice: listening, advocacy,\n",
