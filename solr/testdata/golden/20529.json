            "pageText": "Custody decisions obviously entail consideration of gender, but how gender frames the terms of the debate is not as clear. All too often, analyses of whether fathers or mothers are discriminated against in custody litigation revolve around which parent “gets” the children. It is as if the custody award is a proprietary entitlement, which gives one parent the physical custody of the children and the other parent the right to complain about a gendered decision. Courts and commentators increasingly recognize that the decisional focus must be on the circumstances that are best for the individual child. While some observers acknowledge that custody decisions send messages about the kinds of families a society wants to construct, courts often ignore the larger question of the reconstructive effects of particular tests.\nFeminist Legal Theory and Maternal Preferences\nSome feminist legal theorists are appropriating the domestic sphere as principally the province of women.99 Mary Becker, for example, argues that “a conspiracy of silence forbids discussion of what is common knowledge: Mothers are usually emotionally closer to their children than fathers.”100 The article is replete with mothers’ stories about their relationships with their children. She includes a couple of fathers’ stories, but only for the purpose of attesting to the mothers’ close relationships with their children. Thus, in Becker’s work, the different voice silences the male voice. Moreover, the article seems to disparage the emotional bonds between fathers and children by asserting, “Most mothers describe father’s love as: ‘[L]ess intense, less caring, or less understanding than mother love.’” Becker relies on one mother’s comments to argue that fathers do not have the same empathetic abilities as mothers: “A father just doesn’t seem to feel a child’s hurts and disappointments as his own the way a mother does.”\nBecker advocates a maternal deference standard in custody cases. She claims that “judges should defer to the fit mother’s judgment of the custodial arrangement that would be best.” If this proposal is adopted (which is unlikely for constitutional reasons) or allowed to undergird custody arrangements, it will often prevent men from parenting. Yet Becker is not alone in urging that custody determinations should reflect the special emotional bonds between mother and child.101\nOf more general concern than the specific standard in custody cases is the approach in the theoretical literature to men as parents.
