Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), for example, repeatedly stressed, “We cannot have a procedure for deporting aliens who are allegedly terrorists where they have no opportunity to cross-examine their accusers, no opportunity to see the evidence against them, no opportunity even to know the specific charges” (United States Congress, House, March 13, 1996). His opponents, on the other hand, were convinced that the end justified the means. For them, it was perfectly legitimate to limit a suspected terrorist’s constitutional rights in order to protect the American public.\nYet while the majority was willing to support these antiterrorist provisions, many politicians were reluctant to limit judicial review in cases involving other “criminal aliens.” In the end, Congress basically agreed that the introduction of secret or classified evidence and evidence that had been obtained illegally should only be admissible if there was some kind of national security risk involved. “Alien criminals” who did not pose a national security risk were granted the right to have a counsel and get a public hearing. In addition, their attorneys were granted the right to access all evidence, introduce additional evidence, and cross-examine all witnesses. Importantly, though, the AEDPA also mandated the creation of a special removal court. In all cases involving undocumented immigrants or temporary residents, this court’s deportation order would be final, and the defendant would not get a chance to seek judicial review. Legal permanent residents were still able to appeal a deportation order to the Board of Immigration.\nIn addition, the AEDPA also increased the number of deportable offenses. With the passage of the Anti–Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the United States introduced a new class of crimes: “aggravated felonies.” Initially, this category consisted of a small number of crimes that were deemed serious enough to warrant the deportation of a noncitizen after he or she had completed their criminal sentence in a U.S. prison. Outside of immigration law, the term was meaningless. Shortly after the introduction of this new class of deportable offenses, the term “aggravated felony” underwent a rapid expansion and the crimes that were added to the list were “not necessarily aggravated or felonies” (Family 2010). With the enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990, Congress added all violent crimes for which a court had imposed a minimum sentence of five years in prison.51 In 1996, the AEDPA extended this category even further. Section 435 lowered the ",
