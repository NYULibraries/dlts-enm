Little Dorrit may recoil from Mrs. Clennam’s state of mind, but there are other straight responses to cruelty and meanness, besides the punitive. Mrs. Clennam is allowed too much by way of self-vindication, and Little Dorrit makes Dickens’s point:\n“I have done,” said Mrs. Clennam, “what it was given me to do. I have set myself against evil; not against good. I have been an instrument of severity against sin. Have not mere sinners like myself been commissioned to lay it low in all time!”    “In all time?” repeated Little Dorrit.    “Even if my own wrong had prevailed with me, and my own vengeance had moved me, could I have found no justification? None in the old days when the innocent perished with the guilty, a thousand to one? When the wrath of the hater of the unrighteous was not slaked even in blood, and yet found favour?”    “O, Mrs. Clennam, Mrs. Clennam,” said Little Dorrit, “angry feelings and unforgiving deeds are no comfort and no guide to you and me. My life has been passed in this poor prison, and my teaching has been very defective; but, let me implore you to remember later and better days. Be guided only by the healer of the sick, the raiser of the dead, the friend of all who were afflicted and forlorn, the patient Master who shed tears of compassion for our infirmities. We cannot but be right if we put all the rest away, and do everything in remembrance of Him. There is no vengeance and no infliction of suffering in this life, I am sure.” (792)\nSo, Little Dorrit, silhouetted against “the softened light of the window,” like Agnes, is an angel. But that is the trouble with her: as an embodiment of Christ’s forgiveness she is too much inclined to condone and so to forfeit her own authenticity: she becomes an idealised alhpardoning submissive.\nThe passage makes clear again Dickens’s stand in favor of Christ’s forgiveness, as against an approach to sin based on Deuteronomy (though he is here, I believe, writing in generally biblical language rather than quoting actual scripture). To Mrs. Clennam’s request, “Little Dorrit yielded willingly”—but as they approach the house, the edifice falls.\nWe suppose the point is that, to be truly Christian, one must extend ",
