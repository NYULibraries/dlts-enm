Many lack access to digital technologies; they lack an understanding of how participatory politics works; they do not see themselves as having anything to contribute to larger conversations about politics; they fear that they can not live up to society’s impossible ideals about what constitutes an informed citizen; and they lack the social connections to adopt a more monitorial perspective on social change. Lissa Soep (2014) has identified other potential risks of participatory politics:\nContent worlds can feed sensationalization; they can ultimately be unsustainable and thus set up the participants for disappointment, resentment, cynicism, and missed opportunity; they can reveal a kind of saviorism that denies agency to those with direct knowledge and the most to lose; and they can invite slippage to the extent that participants eager to connect with the widest possible audience sometimes obscure the specificity of particular struggles. (71)\nSome exceptional individuals will find their ways past such obstacles and engage in tactics that are personally meaningful and politically effective. There are always exceptions, but the kinds of organizations we study increase the effectiveness of their political efforts and, more importantly, provide gateways for youth who would not otherwise have been encouraged to participate politically. In that sense, they provide “consequential connections.” Lissa Soep will have more to say about how these practices relate to connected learning in her Afterword.\nDahlgren (2011) discusses such concerns in terms of what he calls “contingencies,” factors that “both facilitate and hinder participation” (100). These constraints push potential participations toward the “solo sphere, a politics focused on ‘personal identity’ rather than ‘collectively intervening in the social world and contesting power relations’” (103–104). Many of the platforms deployed for participatory political practices are privately owned, commercially focused, and often adopt policies more attentive to the corporation’s desire to profit than by a desire to maximize opportunities for participation (Campbell 2009). Some of the youth we’ve discussed here are literally disenfranchised—lacking the basic rights as citizens that might traditionally have allowed them to make their voices heard by democratic institutions—and many others ",
