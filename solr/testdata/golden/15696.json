Recently, among Helenologists, one awful heresy arose, which was condemned and expelled from the mainstream of the science. According to this heterodox dogma, Helen is love, and nothing but love, and since the subject and object of knowledge must eventually coincide, then Helenology is nothing but the growing love for Helen, the highest of all possible acts of knowledge.\n15. However, all these heretics do not provide a single convincing argument that Helen is love. The absence of arguments is justified by the hypothesis that the manifestation of this secret quality of Helen can proceed only from her. The greatest duty of those persisting in heresy is to wait patiently for this manifestation, which will confirm the validity of their faith.\n16. What is argument in science is sacrifice in faith, and there is nothing to be added to it, since I have reached point Z.13\nNOTES\n1. (Editor) This work of Epstein’s, written under the name of Ivan Soloviev, contains many conscious allusions and references to the legacy of the greatest Russian philosopher Vladimir Soloviev (1853–1900). Vladimir Soloviev was the founder of the philosophy of “total-unity,” later adopted by many other Russian thinkers. In the twentieth century, one of its outcomes, ecumenism, became an increasingly influential movement for the reunification of all Christian churches and denominations. Vladimir Soloviev was also the founder of Sophiology, the doctrine about Sophia, the feminine hypostasis of Godhead, the divine wisdom, and the “soul of the universe.” The poetry of Vladimir Soloviev and his followers, Russian symbolists such as Alexander Blok, describes the mystical encounters of the lyric hero with Sophia, personified in the image of Beautiful Lady. According to Vladimir Soloviev, sexual love is the means to overcome individualism and to unite the masculinism and feminine elements as the prototype of the desired total-unity. Vladimir Soloviev developed many aspects of Platonic philosophy, in particular the theme of ideal love, which ascends from the beloved woman to God; however, Soloviev does not oppose the world of Ideas to the material world, but confesses a “religious materialism” that unites Platonism with the Christian notion of the holiness and divine justification of the flesh. “Ivan Soloviev’s Reflections on Eros,” in particular the fragments on contiguity and Helenology, offer “serious parodies” of the cherished conceptions of Vladimir Soloviev ",
