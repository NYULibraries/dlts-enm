            "pageText": "to what Rich calls “compulsory heterosexuality,” I too must be outside the system of heterosexuality. On the other hand, because I was teaching material that the students did not identify me with, I was able to model for them what all of us—not just lesbians—might learn from reading Rich and her critical views of heterosexism. They, I hope, began the work of confronting their own homophobia by first allowing that “normal” people such as myself resist it.\nBy taking this position, I am not suggesting in any way that I can teach lesbian and gay literature better than or from the same point of engaged experience as a lesbian or gay scholar; what I am claiming is the possibility of joining in the struggle against heterosexism. I find Rich’s widely debated idea of the “lesbian continuum,” introduced in her influential essay “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence” (1980), helpful in making a space for such an alliance. In this essay, Rich distinguishes between “lesbian existence”—identified with women who desire “genital sexual experience with another woman”—and the “lesbian continuum”—which includes “a range . . . of woman-identified experience.” Rich eloquently explains why she insists on such a broad view: by\n\nembrac[ing] many more forms of primary intensity between and among women, including the sharing of a rich inner life, the bonding against male tyranny, the giving and receiving of practical and political support . . . we begin to grasp breadths of female history and psychology which have lain out of reach as a consequence of limited, mostly clinical, definitions of lesbianism. 24\n\nRather than totally conflating lesbians and feminists or totally separating them, Rich establishes a middle ground on which lesbians and feminists join together in a common struggle. Hers is a model that does not erase difference but also does not allow difference to be unbridgeable.25\nIn the classroom, we have to work diligently to create those bridges—not only between our own positionality and the text at hand, but also between the diverse kinds of students we have in class.
