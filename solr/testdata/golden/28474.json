According to the dominant political rhetoric, immigration laws failed to protect U.S. citizens from an overwhelming influx of undesirable immigrants who, unlike previous generations of newcomers, were reluctant to blend in with the majority culture and contribute to the economy. Politicians frequently referred to this seemingly unprecedented crisis in their calls for immediate and drastic immigration reform measures.
