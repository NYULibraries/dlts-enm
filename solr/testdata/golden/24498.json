For others it is a matter of survival at many levels.\nThe freedom to perform critical analysis is the most highly touted function of the academy. And if freedom is the very soul of inquiry, then objectivity is the flesh and bones. I have often wondered, not so much at the putative power of the intellect over the sensate, but that the two means of knowing are often presented as an either-or proposition, while the spiritual has been removed from the formula entirely. Academic perspective is either internal or external; it is never both simultaneously; it rarely reflects the motion of life.
