This would form a short movement phrase, which would progress into a longer phrase as the participants shared their gestures and taught each other. When music is added a self expressive dance is created. The end result is participation in creative communication and expression through dance. We have done many different choreography and improvisation exercises, all focusing on creativity and communication. In the workshop we try to expand our ideas on what dance is, and move beyond what is seen everyday in music videos and dance clubs.” Amy Martin, letter to Deputy Director Dan Bolden, March 24, 1999.\n24. Judy Rice, letter to Dan Bolden, March 24, 1999.\n25. Author's letter to Dan Bolden, March 29, 1999.\n26. Letter from Julie Southwick to author, April 2, 1999. We actually began to take him up on the dance theory offer. We received permission to have such a class at Florence Crane, taught by two students from the School of Dance who had experience in English 319.

Because of the schedules of the two women and eventually because of the move from Florence Crane to Western Wayne, we never got beyond a couple of class sessions.\n27. This quotation is from her English 319 journal.\nChapter Five\n1. From a conversation at the time with Luella Burke, who was the first warden at the Baldwin Facility. The turnover rate of officers was high: they would train at Baldwin, then apply for higher-paying officer jobs in the state system. We know that youth sentenced to adult facilities have a higher rate of committing later crimes than youth sentenced to juvenile facilities. See the Campaign for Youth Justice, “Youth in Adult Prisons Fact Sheet,” February 2005, http://www.act4jj.org/media/fact sheets/factsheet_26.pdf; and the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice and their book The Changing Borders of Juvenile Justice: Transfer of Adolescents to the Criminal Court, ed. Jeffrey Fagan and Franklin Zimring (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000).\n2. I have altered the punctuation and tightened a little, for the reader's sake; the content is not changed.\n3. It has been as many as fourteen. Two prisons have closed and others are being consolidated into single prisons. If we traveled an hour and forty-five minutes, in summer 2009 we could reach twenty-six prisons and camps.\n4. The confiscation, or forbidding, of costumes, including wigs and masks, is justified by the fear that prisoners will keep them and use them as disguises to escape. With 244 plays to our credit, this has never happened. It is probably very rare in general \n",
