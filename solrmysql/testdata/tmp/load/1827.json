            "pageText": "\ngovernment is facing a lot of challenges.” Among the economic challenges, according to one reporter, “are balancing the supersize growth and heavy investment, and trying to distribute the riches as evenly as possible” (Barboza 2007a).\nThe discursive construction of China also contains the theme that Beijing is under pressure to allow the Chinese currency, the yuan, to appreciate more quickly against the dollar in the hope of easing the country's trade surplus with the United States. Chinese officials, however, assert “that the pace of currency revaluation must be measured and that they will not be pressed into moving hastily” (Barboza 2007d). Reports on the value of the yuan against the dollar are common. One story notes, for example, that the yuan strengthened somewhat against the dollar in 2006, “climbing to about 7.8 yuan to the dollar, from 8.26 yuan in 2005.” News stories about the yuan explain that economists “have warned that if the yuan does not continue to appreciate against the dollar and other major currencies, China could face protectionist action, which could pose an even more serious threat to economic growth” (Barboza 2007b).\nChina also faces concerns about its “enormous rise in bank loans” (Barboza 2006, C8); “too much money in the financial system,” the media assert, “could ignite inflation and perhaps fuel a stock market bubble.” In January 2007, China's central bank is reported to have “raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks, the fourth increase in six months, to further tighten the nation's money supply,” a move that increased “the reserve ratio by half a percentage point to 9.5 percent.” “Raising the amount of cash reserves that Chinese banks keep on hand with the central bank,” the media's narrative explains, “effectively restricts the amount of money that banks can lend” and curbs “excessive lending to new factories, real estate projects, and road construction” (Barboza 2007a).\nChina's potential unreliability as an economic partner is also developed in media accounts through stories about the environmental devastation its economic growth has generated. For the Chinese government, these stories assert, the question is how to address the country's environmental problems without crippling the economy: “China, it seems, has reached a tipping point familiar to many developed countries, including the United States, that have raced headlong after economic development only to look up suddenly and see the environmental carnage. The difference with China, as is so often the case, is that the potential problems are much bigger, have happened much\n",
