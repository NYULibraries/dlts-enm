By the 1880s advertisements for positions in America virtually disappeared from the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums.\n37. AZJ 10/20, 335; 28/19.\n38. Some of the many stories on building institutions or raising money in American Jewish communities reported in the AZJ are found in the following issues: 19/17, 19/28, 19/31, 28/8, 28/19, 28/53, 32/4, 32/24, 32/36, 32/39, 32/49, 32/50, 38/4, 38/12, 38/21.\n39. A good example of a very negative view of American culture and life in Weimar Germany is Adolf Halfeld, Amerika und der Amerikanismus: Kritische Betrachtungen eines Deutschen und Europäers (Jena: Diede-richs, 1927).\n40. The C.V. Zeitung, for instance, includes a book review by Dr. Margarete Wiener of an autobiography of an American Jew (1926) that speaks of the failings of American culture. It uses standard anti-American language about Amerikanische Ungeist and speaks of the choice between “hypocritical religion and Prohibition on the one hand, and the raw vulgarity of the street and baseball mania on the other” (C.V. Zeitung 5:247–48). Another anti-American article is a humorous feuilleton called “Wie würde Amerika das machen?” (C.V. Zeitung 4/18 [March 1, 1925]) that describes in exaggerated fashion the lengths to which an American businessman would go to advertise his shoes.\n41. Jüdische Rundschau gave far more space to international affairs in general than did the C.V. Zeitung, which was oriented mainly to issues of antisemitism in the early 1920s. Stories on America were rather uncommon in the C.V. Zeitung and often took the form of book reviews of American Jewish books, quotes from the American Jewish press, or discussions of American antisemitism (especially the Ku Klux Klan and the writings of Henry Ford). Sometimes they quoted anti-Zionist statements by leaders of American Reform Judaism. Except for a few articles by Ismar Elbogen (August 9, 1923, 1926: vol. 5, no. 51), who had spent time giving lectures in America, the C.V. Zeitung rarely carried reports from correspondents with direct knowledge of American Jewry. They often turned to interviews with visiting American Jews to get basic information on American Jewish life. This includes an interview with Dr. Julian Morgenstern, president of Hebrew Union College (July 2, 1926) and even with a visiting American subscriber, Mr. Bernstein of Chicago (August 2, 1923). This latter case especially shows how few sources of information the newspaper had even in the 1920s.\nOccasionally the C.V. Zeitung showed hostility toward American Jewry, as in its article of July 27, 1922, “Die deutsch jüdische Wissenschaft ",
