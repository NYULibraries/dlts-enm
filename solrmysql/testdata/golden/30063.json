            "pageText": "they must repeatedly answer America’s call to imaginatively experience the West. The subject of call center labor, then, is formed through a displacement as their inhabitance is both immediate and intentionally faraway. She is formed through the newly aligned conditions of her imagined and performed placement into a place that she will likely never go. Most agents have lived most of their lives oriented primarily toward India, so the reorientation that call center labor demands generates intensely new conditions for subject formation. Appadurai ([1996] 2000) has adeptly noted the ways in the emergence of technoscapes, financescapes, and in particular mediascapes have reconstituted—indeed reterritorialized—the global terrain of subject formation within India.7 As we argue above, however, Appadurai does not account for the most recent shift in the ways these scapes converge to constitute a new landscape for subject formation for call center agents.8 The interactive nature of call center labor—in which agents actively participate in and perform their encounter with mediated America—generates a new relationship among these forces of globalization.\nThe interactive relationship between faraway agents and callers enabled by telecommunications reconfigures the parameters of migration. Call center labor provides agents with the modernizing aspects of identity formation that Appadurai associates with physical migration, yet their access to such processes is mediated through virtual connectivities.9 Attending to the intensity and affective dimensions of agents’ experience of virtual migration deepens Aneesh’s (2006) compelling insights into this new form of global (im)mobility. The mediated intimacies between agents and consumers give agents a sense of touching, interacting with, and being oriented toward America. Agents actively produce this sense of proximity to the American caller as they consume (internalize) and perform (externalize) American identities. These performances place the call center agent in an imagined relationship with customers in which she must both consume America and be consumed by America. She must proactively cultivate her performance of self in ways that are intelligible to Americans, assimilating as if she had migrated to the United States.\nAgents must undergo tremendous psychic transformations in order to build a sense of sameness and in turn a sense of proximity to American customers. They must internalize American culture, images, modes of communication, and knowledge, then externalize those forms of expertise. This labor might be productively understood as biopolitical—as producing the call center agent as a modern subject through a dual process of ",
