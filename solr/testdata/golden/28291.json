There was no recognition of a separate Serbian state within Bosnia. Rather, the international community recognized the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n9. The concept of revisionism should be carefully defined. In this context, I use the term without specific reference to the traditional ideological spectrum with its right and left axes. Rather, in this account, the term “revisionism” denotes the attempt to recast history and current affairs in order to justify a particular agenda.\nBy “moral relativism” I mean the attempt to sweep away any absolutes of conduct. I include the notion of moral equivalence, which in the context of the Serbian propaganda campaign presupposes a relativist climate, although the two terms are distinct.\n10. The story of John Kennedy was revealed by Robert Hardman, “Lobbyist Has Clutch of Royal Contacts,” Daily Telegraph, January 28, 1995; and by David Leppard and Adrian Levy, Sunday Times, January 29, 1995. Kennedy had stood for Parliament as a Conservative candidate, worked for a number of lobbyists and Prince Michael of Kent. He was also a researcher for Henry Bellingham, the private secretary of the then defense secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. The Sunday Times article described Kennedy as a “Serbian hardliner” and reported on an intelligence dossier assembled on him which “claimed to show that the 29-year old Yugoslavian born aristocrat is the figurehead of a network of Serbian militants who have gained a foothold in Britain.” The Daily Telegraph article stated that Kennedy had promoted the “interests of a group of Serbian industrialists in London” and reported that “In the last few years, he has had many meetings with the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Radovan Karadžić, and the Serbian President, Mr. Slobodan Milošević. Referred to as ‘Senator Kennedy’ by elements of the media in Belgrade, he has arranged trips to the former Yugoslavia for British MPs.”\n11. The press conference was scheduled for noon on July 15, 1992. Later that day, Karadžić again promised a cease-fire. For a discussion of Karadžić’s visit to London and meeting with Lord Carrington, see Mark Almond, Europe’s Backyard War (London: Mandarin, 1994), 251.\n12. Storer Rowley’s reliance on Ostojić’s information was immediately evident from his description of the tunnel. Rowley wrote, “South of Sarajevo, Serbs said, Bosnian forces routed Serbs living in towns like Bradina, killing and executing some Serb prisoners and keeping up to 3,000 Serb civilians in a dark railroad tunnel for several days. Other Serbs were said to have been held inhumanely in grain silos in the nearby town of Tarcin and in a ‘concentration camp’ at Konjic.” See “Atrocities Mount in Bosnian War,” Chicago Tribune, June 22, 1992.\n13. Rowley’s article first appeared in the Chicago Tribune on June 22, 1992, as “Atrocities Mount in Bosnian War.” On June 24, it was published in the Toronto Star with the title “The Brutal Killing Fields of Bosnia.” The same day, the Calgary Herald offered ",
