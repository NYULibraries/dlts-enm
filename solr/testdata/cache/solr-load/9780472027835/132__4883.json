For instance, the layout plays a significant role in conveying meaning and in eliciting artifact emotions in Silent Hill: Paint It Black and Silent Hill: Among the Damned (2006) both by Scott Ciencin (story) and Shaun Thomas (art). However, relying on fixed images, comic books cannot reproduce the experiential flow of video games, as a movie can do.\nFilming the Game\nWith a long section of the third chapter displaying the cinematic experience offered by the series, that there is a Silent Hill film (2006) goes almost without saying, especially since the video game has become, in recent years, a new source of material for films.5 The French film director Christophe Gans—a hardcore gamer himself—talked about Silent Hill in the press long before he got to adapt it to the silver screen. According to his comments quoted at the end of the fourth chapter, he holds both SH2 and the series in high esteem. His philosophy goes in the opposite direction of the approach taken by Paul W. S. Anderson for the Resident Evil films or, worse, by Uwe Boll for Alone in the Dark.6 For Gans, who had to convince Team Silent to grant him the rights, it was not simply a question of profiting from the game's popularity, to resort to its characters or setting or to be inspired by videoludic aesthetics. He adapted the original material with all the consideration it deserves. “For me,” he says in an interview on the film's French website,\na good game is exactly like opening a good book or listening to a good record. In fact, no matter the support, it is only the quality of the emotion that counts. My work as a film director simply consists of finding the most effective and the most respectful way of carrying this experience to a new medium—the cinema in this particular case.... [It is] more complex for Silent Hill in that all people who played this game have in a way visited Silent Hill and have fond and personal memories. (2006; my translation)7\nFor the purpose of the seventh art, plot elements from SH1, SH3, and SH2 are brought into the foreground, as well as the characters' psychology. It is now a mother, Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell), who is going to walk through Silent Hill. Rose cannot accept the strange ache Sharon (and not Cheryl, played by Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from and that could confine\n",
