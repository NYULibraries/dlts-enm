We kept telling ourselves that good pilots never crash, and I knew I was good.\nI was taken captive on February 9, 1970. It was an ordinary flight. Egyptian airplanes were detected crossing the border, and we were alerted. Two Mirages were sent toward them. I managed to hit two, but I was too close to the second when I fired, so my own plane was hit also. My mirrors reflected fire at the rear. Soon the whole plane was on fire and spinning down. I knew I had to jump. I tried to eject myself by pulling the upper handle, but it didn’t work. I tried the emergency handle and was ejected. Outside I heard planes firing at each other. To my utter amazement, the ejection mechanism threw me out with the chair, so I was in the ridiculous position of parachuting while sitting on a chair [laughing]. It took me about ten minutes to land, and I found myself in a marsh area, something like a big rice field.\nWhile I was parachuting, I was planning how to get rid of some of the things I carried on me. I remembered a story of a pilot whose finger was almost chopped off because of his gold wedding ring. I threw away some things, including my watch and the maps I carried.

My radio was supposed to transmit SOS signals to the rescue team. I saw my Number 2 passing above, still in combat; then more planes arrived, circling above me. At that moment two men approached. They were dressed in rags, as fellahin [farmers] are, carrying hunting rifles, and I realized that I didn’t stand a chance against them. And I was certain that within moments I would be rescued. So I raised my hands with the pistol and threw away the radio. The fellahin were promptly joined by others, all highly excited. They formed a line and took me to the village.\nThey asked me who I was, and I said, “Anna Russie” [I’m Russian]. I hoped they’d believe me. They behaved politely and even offered me a hand-rolled cigarette. It disgusted me, but I didn’t want to hurt their feelings, so I smoked it.
