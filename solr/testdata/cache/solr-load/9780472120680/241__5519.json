They draw sustenance from the material form of the almanac, yet the possibility or necessity of eating the pages is most likely one not foreseen by the former keepers of the almanac.\n111.

Involving and crediting the spatial dimensions of the text, equally, with the production of meaning, the almanac refuses to privilege the narrative’s temporal development at the expense of its material, spatial form. Almanac of the Dead thereby marks the imbrication of hegemonic understandings of narrative in a Cartesian spatiotemporal distinction that abstracts the narrative’s temporal progression, read as its “meaning,” from its medium, its spatial instantiation. The subordination of the spatial aspects of texts to the narrative’s figurative meaning was the basis of a wholesale discrediting of the glyphs, colors, and pictographs that were central to the Azteca codices’ meaning. This discrediting of Azteca expressive forms was, furthermore, part and parcel of a broader subjugation of non-European cultures to the narratives as well as the narrative forms of European history.\n121.
