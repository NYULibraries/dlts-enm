Cohen refused to draw this inference, on the ground of the “whole” not being “an object of knowledge.” However, once we grant that it is not knowledge in the technical sense, that we seek but grounds for faith, such an application becomes logically incontrovertible. And who would be so bold as to scorn the converging rays of knowledge, leading from the finite to the infinite, in the idle quest for full and clear comprehension, for the total embracing of the Deity within the canons of our understanding? Furthermore, the “whole,” in a qualitative sense, is given to us in our consciousness of our own personality, as will be made clear in the sequel. The human personality is a chunk of reality and it is understandable only in terms of the polar concepts of purposiveness and mechanism. May it not be then that God and the mechanical universe imply each other, even as the one and the many, space and time, the point and the field? But we are anticipating our argument. Let us return to the task of discovering the fundamental operating concepts in the universe.\nWhen we envisage the whole of existence, in all its mysterious immensity and grandeur, what are the alternative concepts before us? What is the real difference between the naturalists and the theists? Manifestly, the former maintain that the whole is merely a numerical summation of all that exists, with the laws that regulate the finite parts of the visible universe prevailing throughout its invisible and non-reachable positions. The other alternative consists in the attribution to the whole of the qualities of selfhood, consciousness, and purposiveness.\nFor our present purpose, we may leave out of consideration all transcendental conceptions of the Deity, since they do not assume that creation points to the Creator in any sense save that of logical contradiction or of historical failure. In the transcendental view, the examination of the world about us cannot possibly of itself lead to the idea of God. It is when we realize our “nothingness” and humbly admit our failure, that the Wholly Other is revealed to us. Transcendentalism, by its very definition, cannot favor the endeavor to understand the ultimate nature of being through the instrumentality of reason. Hence the choice before us is the whole as a mechanical summation of parts versus the whole as being a self in which particulars may be related to the totality of being in the categories of purposiveness and consciousness.\nThe naturalist alternative is simply an extension into the infinite of our experience with the physical universe. The theistic position regards our experience with living selves as providing the clue for the understanding ",
