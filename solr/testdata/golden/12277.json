            "pageText": "disgust of his friends was itself evidence of the vastness, and therefore of the grandeur and the moral necessity, of the sacrifice.”150\nPerhaps the most eloquent Russian spokesman for the idea of a masochistic Russian intelligentsia was the writer and critic Dmitrii Mer-ezhkovskii (1865-1941). In that volume of his collected works titled “Sick Russia,” Merezhkovskii repeatedly asserts that Russians—especially members of the intelligentsia—are slavish by nature. Russians cannot be “holy,” he says, without being slavish, because when they are free they are sinful: “In freedom they are sinful, in slavery they are holy”; “Holy Russia is a land of holy slaves.”151 Merezhkovskii advances the idea that the numerous rebellions in Russian history never amounted to much because the rebels (Pugachev and his crew, the Decembrists, etc.) always wanted to be defeated. The long line of Russian uprisings constitutes “an eternal rebellion of eternal slaves.”152 Characterizing the memoirs of the famous serf-turned-censor Aleksandr Nikitenko (1804-77), Merezhkovskii says: “A slavish book about a slavish life. The writer is doubly a slave, both by birth and by calling— a serf and a censor.”153\nMerezhkovskii, writing under the influence of Viacheslav Ivanov (1866-1949), describes Russians in a way that strongly suggests the modern psychoanalytic conception of moral masochism: “Self-denunciation and self-humiliation [Samooblichenie—samooplevanie, literally “spitting on the self”] are generally characteristic of Russian people.”154 Among Russians there is a “terrible will to descent, to disrobing, to self-destruction, to chaos.”155 Merezhkovskii (unlike Ivanov) actually uses the word “masochism” (“mazokhizm”). It occurs in reference to the suddenly repentant attitude of some of the intelligentsia after the events of January 9, 1905 (so-called “Bloody Sunday,” when tsarist police fired on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Petersburg, killing over a hundred people). Here is how Merezhkovskii describes a “former Marxist” who was castigating the “ignoble Russian revolution”:\nHis eyes shone with that delight of self-flagellation, self-destruction [samoistre-bleniia], that voluptuousness of shame which in the moral realm correspond to the physical voluptuousness of blows, to masochism [sootvetstvuiut fiz-icheskomu sladostrastiiu poboev, mazokhizmu].156\nThese words, written in 1909, predate Freud’s writings on moral masochism by some fifteen years.157 The similarity is remarkable.
