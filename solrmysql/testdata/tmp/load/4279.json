Writing in the wake of the culture wars of the 1990s, Eric Foner, in a 2002 collection of essays entitled Who Owns History?, called for historians not to shy away from engaging in debate over history with the “larger public.”11 Learning Wikipedia's evolving rules equips students to join the fight digitally. The struggle, unlike debates in print, occurs very publicly, is likely to be multivocal, and is often very fast-paced. It is not for the faint of heart.\nContributing to Wikipedia is a continuing, sometimes confusing and heated conversation that also blurs the boundary between author and reader. In Wikipedia, as cultural critic Dubravka Ugresic writes, “the balance of power formerly dominated by Author and Work, has been flipped in favor of the Recipient…. transforming perception, comprehension, and taste.”12 Students may not be aware of all these transformations, but they certainly feel the loss of ownership of their work when they click Wikipedia's “Submit” button. Many have invested considerable work and time into formulating well-researched, cogent content, only to see it challenged, condensed, paraphrased, moved to a different location, or deleted altogether. Jimmy Wales, aware of the problem of potentially unreliable material, said in a recent interview, “Now there is an increasing focus on quality and referencing.”13 But unreliability and what seem to be arbitrary revisions of well-researched material remain particularly problematic when alterations appear to be motivated by sexism (in one instance, a kind of reverse sexism) and/or American exceptionalist bias. This notion will be explored in greater depth below.\nElsewhere in this volume, Robert Wolff found that in his study of discussions of the causes of the Civil War, the “Wikipedia community does effectively gauge basic historical knowledge and can exclude claims that lack a factual basis.”14 We learned, however, that crowdsourced judgments on women's history were more problematic. Some editors regard the insistence that women's historical experience is sometimes distinct from men's as a priori “inappropriate” and/or “irrelevant.” Others find that discussing discrimination that has accompanied many of women's efforts to be included in mainstream activities does not pass muster because it is anachronistic or not neutral in point of view.\nStudents encountered acceptance, mild resistance, and vigorous opposition to women's content in Wikipedia. I recommended that students consider integrating women's experience into broad subjects, on the theory that this is both more challenging intellectually and, ultimately, more to the point of the overall project of bringing women into our acknowledged history. Adding a section that can be easily overlooked and that seems,\n",
