Unlike video designed for consoles with known computing and rendering capability, web-based environments assume a universal audience. Issues of accessibility that come with publicly sponsored programs can place limits on the types of media that can be hosted on a site. Designed for the lowest common denominator, these websites can never be cutting edge. Though there will always be some constraints on a public website, improvements in the general level of personal computing technology should present less restrictive specifications for web designers in the future. Finally, there is always the issue of what is politically acceptable in a publicly sponsored website. For example, it would be inadvisable to show a whale hunt on a website, even though it represents an important aspect of the lives of many Northern communities.\nThe Kiosk: Museum of Civilization\nA few years earlier, a kiosk installation was constructed at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, Ottawa. As part of a special exhibition, “Journey to Kitgaaryuk,” sponsored jointly by the Canadian Museum of Civilization and the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, an interactive world was developed for a stand-alone kiosk.19 The experience first provided a tour of the outside of an Inuit sod house. The house, a traditional Mackenzie Delta Inuit winter house, was modeled using archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric data. These types of dwellings would have been constructed out of wood, sod, and caribou or muskox hide even as late as the early nineteenth century. In constructing this virtual model, the user began by exploring the outside of the structure. Once inside, the interior could be examined. Clicking on artifacts located on the sleeping platform of the dwelling activated a video that showed how the objects were used in daily life. For example, clicking on a stone ulu initiated a movie that showed a member of the Inuvialuit community creating a sealskin parka. Located at the center of the gallery, visitors could interact with a virtual model of a sod house while being surrounded by actual artifacts from the region. Like many virtual worlds, one tracker ball provided control over the environment. Several audio headphones were attached to the single kiosk. Curiously, having the control of the environment in the hands of a single person did not present any serious barriers for small groups. One person would naturally gravitate toward navigating the world, while other participants would offer suggestions about where to go next, or would ask ",
