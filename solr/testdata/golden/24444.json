Employing it as a critical location from which to theorize about womanhood, female identity, and sexuality, I recently taught an undergraduate course called Redefining Womanhood: (Re)-writing the Black Female Self, organized around essays, poetry, and short stories in Homegirls.

Never having taught a lesbian text, I had to resist the fear that my reading and representation of it pedagogically would appropriate or exploit the discursive practice of black women for the sake of my own “male-conceived” ideas of how I wanted to destabilize female heterosexuality. Yet I knew that Audre Lorde’s essay “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power” would offer the precise theoretical model to read black lesbian fiction.\nIn fact, “Uses of the Erotic,” as an essay critically engaged in clarifying the personal/spiritual/political dimensions of female power as erotic expression, works in paradigmatic relationship to an autobiographical short story Lorde composed for Homegirls entitled ",
