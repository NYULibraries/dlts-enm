            "pageText": "There is a “lavender vote” in America, as opposed merely to gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters. It is characterized mainly by strong liberalism on domestic social issues among those who openly identify themselves as bisexual, lesbian, or gay. Although most self-identified LGBs are generally far more liberal and (among women) feminist than the rest of the population, some of their greater liberalism on social issues can be attributed solely to sexual identity. That is, regardless of their stands on other issues, LGB-identified people are more liberal than the rest of the population on cultural issues—including abortion rights, the environment, and drug policy—because of the experience of being lesbian, bisexual, or gay and facing the hostility of cultural conservatives.\nThe LGB vote is remarkable for its partisan fluidity. Although, all other things being equal, they tend to vote for Democrats in high-salience elections in which one candidate is clearly more “progay” than the other, LGB voters can be counted on to support the progay candidate, regardless of party, by margins of about three to one. Absent a high-salience contest, the vote splinters: two-thirds of self-identified LGBs split their tickets in 1990, exactly the same proportion as the rest of the population. About one in six LGB voters in lower-salience contests may support liberal or leftist independents as opposed to Democratic nominees. About one in four LGB voters appear to support Republicans, at least in contests in which the economy or foreign policy issues are paramount as opposed to social issues, and in a traditionalistic Southern state such as Texas many more LGBs may vote Republican.\nTherefore, the lavender vote is up for grabs. Its social liberalism does not equate with voting for the Democrats. Democrats who take LGB voters for granted and Republicans who write off or deliberately alienate them both are making a serious mistake.\nWhen we consider voters who identify themselves as gay or lesbian, the proportion of the gay and lesbian vote is small, just over 1 percent of the national voting population in 1990. When self-identified bisexuals are included this figure doubles, and equals the share of Latino voters in the United States. The rate of identification by age group tells us that its size may grow to about 4 or 5 percent of the total in the next twenty years.\nAlthough LGB-oriented political activists do appear to have some effect in drawing attention to certain important contests, in a race in which an openly LGB candidate is seeking election, a majority of LGB voters appear to require the validation of that person’s candidacy by non-LGB-oriented media and/or organizations in order to consider the candidate “serious.”\n",
