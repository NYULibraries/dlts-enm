Gelber, Toledot Yehude Brody, in the series Irim v’lmahot b’Israel (Jerusalem: Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1955), vol. 6, pp. 173-236.\n15. This despite the efforts of Austrian government to compel the Jews to provide a general education. Rawidowicz relates that Krochmal’s mother paid six ducats a year to the “German school,” with the proviso that Nachman did not have to attend. In general, Galician Jewry fought vigorously against the government-sponsored schools, and they were abolished in 1809.\n16. In a letter written a few months before his death to his son Abraham (who was then approximately fourteen; see Isma Schorsch, “The Production of a Classic: Zunz as Krochmal’s Editor,” LBIY (1986), p. 284, n. 16 and text thereto), Krochmal exhorts him not to cease learning Talmud and Codes, while also continuing his studies in the German and Hebrew languages. The goal of study, he wrote, was ‘shlemut,’ comprehensive knowledge, which required knowledge of classical Jewish sources.\n17. So Leopold Zunz, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 2 (Berlin: 1876), p. 151: “Im Herbst 1798, also noch nicht 14 Jahre alt, ward Krochmal verheirathet.” Rapoport reports that Krochmal married at sixteen or seventeen, but Zunz’s date, also reported by Letteris, would seem to be confirmed by the letter of Krochmal’s son-in-law to Zunz, shortly after the publication of Zunz’s necrology. See Schorsch, p. 285 and letter thirteen there, p. 303.\n18. For the date, see Schorsch, ibid.\n19. I will discuss the influence these works exercised on Krochmal’s thought in the subsequent chapters.\n20. Schorsch, ibid.\n21. Quoted by Rawidowicz, p. 32. The rather flowery language derives from the biblical Song of Songs which Bloch quotes and paraphrases.\n22. For further details, see Rawidowicz, pp. 30ff.\n23. See ibid., pp. 32-33.\n24. Krochmal was drawn to business pursuits by the death of his mother-in-law, with whom he lived, in 1814, at the same time that his previously well-to-do father’s circumstances had taken a turn for the worse. Thus, at the age of twenty-nine, Krochmal was forced to begin supporting himself for the first time.\n25. Krochmal’s report of the incident denies that he maintained a correspondence, ",
