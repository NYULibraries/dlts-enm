Yet Jaffer, who is a Muslim in a predominantly Hindu country, finds that here in the call center, his religion doesn’t matter because everyone has to take on another identity. At work, Jaffer is Marc. He lives in virtual borderlands—somewhere between India and the United States, never fully a part of either. Jaffer shares his concern over the consumerism of the call center culture: “In this industry, money matters over culture.” For him, the border space generated by the phone call places him in a space of alterity. Such a mundane task as calling a friend becomes unsettled as he slips, uncannily, into a virtual borderlands. The global continually animates and interpenetrates the local. India is no longer just India but is also intimately inhabited by America.\n Our reading of call center labor productively extends Arjun Appadurai’s ([1996] 2000) notion of the various scapes—media, ethno, techno, ideo, and finance—that enable massive new global connectivities within late modernity.28 Agents, as with many young Indians of their generation, begin their immersion in American culture long before working in the industry. When India opened its economic and media markets to the West in 1991,29 the distribution of Western images, narratives, and cultural values permeated what Appadurai calls the mediascape of India’s media markets. What’s different in call center labor is that agents watch American sitcoms, movies, and television dramas not merely to consume these images. They watch to become fluent in American culture and accent. Consuming American media, Pavitra explains, such as “watch[ing] the series of Friends,” is one way agents learn to emulate American culture: “That’s the way the customers would speak to us and that’s the right way of what we need to know.” As we explore in greater detail in chapter 2, the call center industry mobilizes mediascapes through the technoscapes and financescapes of virtual labor to generate new ethnoscapes within India. Call center labor generates an interactive, mediated process in which agents perform Americanness for Americans. This interactivity distinguishes the conditions for agents’ subject formation from those in Appadurai’s account. Call center labor places agents in a virtual relationship with customers in which call center agents not only consume America but must also be consumed by America: they must proactively cultivate their performance of self in ways that are intelligible to Americans, as if they had migrated to the United ",
