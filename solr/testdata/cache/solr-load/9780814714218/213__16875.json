            "pageText": "valuable actions contradicts its prescriptive side. The existence of these actions is the basis for the second and more fundamental objection to any version of standard consequentialism, for example, to universal commodification, anticipated in section 3.\nInternally motivated actions are undertaken by a person because of the value that person perceives in or attaches to his performance of that action, to the relations it places him in, or to the overall scheme or way of life that is partly constituted by his performance of that action. When value attaches to this person’s action in virtue of the value that attaches to the relations or ways of life the action helps to constitute, there is a sense in which the value adheres to the action because of the value of the action’s results. Yet in such a case there is a complex interplay between the value of the result and the value perceived in the action itself. One values another’s being better off as a result of one’s generosity. But it is at least partially that other person’s being better off by means of one’s act that one values and that feeds back into the value of one’s generous act. In contrast, an action is instrumentally motivated insofar as it is performed for the sake of an outcome that is conceived of and valued entirely separately from one’s performance. The value of the action entirely derives from the external value of its yield.\nIt seems clear that there are internally motivated activities; except to the dedicated moral skeptic or standard consequen-tialist, it seems plausible that some of these are internally valuable. Productive activity carried on for its own sake, the proverbial self-actualizing work, epitomizes internally motivated and valuable activity. Economic activity engaged in for the sake of payment, in cash or kind, the proverbial alienating labor, epitomizes instrumentally motivated and, at most, instrumentally valuable action. The monetary domino theory, requiring as it does disbelief in universal commodification, requires belief in internally motivated and valuable activities. These must exist so that monetary domino processes can threaten their extinction.\nYet, rather than heighten fears about monetary domino processes, I think that this distinction helps allay them in two ways. The first way, already mentioned and to be re-emphasized in the next section, is that the distinction reminds us of how readily people operating out there in the real world can identify and be motivated by the value of various activities and relations and ",
