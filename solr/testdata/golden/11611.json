Krochmal’s Guide comes to serve as a response to these challenges, to guide those perplexed by them to a philosophically grounded, traditionally compatible faith.\nTeleology, Intention and the Existence of God\nKrochmal opens his discussion of teleology and intention with the following citation from rabbinic literature:\nIt is comparable to one who was wandering about and saw a castle burning.
