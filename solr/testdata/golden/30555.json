Later medieval understandings of gestation and growth were interested in delimiting material and environmental impingements (efficient or material causes, whatever the formal or final causes, as mentioned). So, for example, Giles of Rome lists ten causes in his De formatione corporis humani in utero: quality and quantity of sperm, the age of the father, the place and disposition of the testicles, the fetus’s location in the womb, the complexion of the mestruum, the diet of parents, the seasons and winds, and the planets.52 Several different variables come up elsewhere in the literature.53 Diet is obviously an important factor in many discussions, as food is ever a determining element and potential contaminant.54 Peter Lombard’s Sentences acknowledges that the body “grows with nourishment of foods and other things,”55 and Adelard of Bath goes much further, as we will see later, arguing that food effectively invades and infects the human subject. Then, depending on where the fetus falls in the womb, the child may be ambiguously sexed. For William of Conches, the matter is an accident of topology and temperature: “if [the sperm] lies on the right side, which is warmer from its proximity to the liver, the fetus is fed by better and warmer blood, so becoming male. But if it lies on the left side, which is colder, it becomes female; if on the right, but a little toward the left, an effeminate man; if on the left, but a little to the right, a manly woman.”56 Others too explain that if the seed falls in the middle chamber of the womb, either nothing will come to fruition or a hermaphrodite will issue (“yf hit so be-fall þat hit be conceyvyde þer, hit schall have þe tokyn of man \u0026 of woman, þat ys bothe yerde [penis] and wikket [vulva], as hit hath be seynne heere be-fore in many cuntryes”).57 Women who desire a male or female child should raise the hip opposite to that side on which they wish to conceive. Every fetus basically starts life intersex or polymorphous, in the process of being engendered from within an ambiguous space of becoming (monstrous to some), until a set of highly contingent circumstances determines the issue one way or another.58\n        Character, appearance, health, aptitude, and general well-being are unpredictable permutations, and all emerge epigenetically. Nothing is securely preformed.59 A fourteenth-century scholar wonders at the amazing risks involved in reproduction, because such “a small difference ",
