Extreme environments mark a momentary or extended period of ontological insecurity; physical circumstances of place are now uncertain, and traditional coping strategies are increasingly ineffective.\nPerhaps it is not particularly useful for most of us to consider causal direction at those moments when physical states mirror ideal meanings. But when bodies and environments are incoherent and conventional meanings no longer make sense, people are apt to conceptualize their somatic and environmental distress, theorizing their misery in a manner that allows them to understand and manage it. Environmental illness is a theory of the body and the environment constructed of necessity, driven by discomfort and pain. It joins a mind to a body that is no longer readily intelligible by cobbling together clusters of words to tell a story of disease.\nIf sick bodies are organizing thoughts, as we propose, it is worth pausing to assay these bodies as they are experienced by the persons who inhabit them. Consider the following several descriptions of sick bodies offered by people who would later interpret themselves as environmentally ill.\nA “partially disabled building contractor” writes:\nMy body becomes my worst nightmare. I feel like Freddie [from the movie Nightmare on Elm Street] lives inside me. I start to drool uncontrollably. I get confused … forgetting where I am. I feel electrical shocks inside my skin. I want to scratch my skin off, but it hurts too much to touch it. Sometimes I just cry and my fingernails turn blue. My tongue gets thick and rolls around in my mouth like a big piece of fat. Eating makes me gag. I want to sleep but I’m too nervous.\nA retired program analyst for the Department of Defense describes her body as\nItching and burning. With headache, chills, sweats, numbness, and swelling in my hands, pain along my right arm and in the ball of my left foot, gastrointestinal problems (nausea, dysentery, … constipation), bodies and their material surroundings with imperfect knowledge.
