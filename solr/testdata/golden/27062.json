The book opens with Bigger trying to protect his mother, sister, and little brother from a large rat. “A huge black rat squealed and leaped at Bigger’s trouser-leg and snagged it in his teeth.... Bigger took a shoe and pounded the rat’s head, crushing it, cursing hysterically.... His mother sank to her knees and buried her face in the quilts and sobbed.” Bigger Thomas turned his rage outward, eventually killing two people. As Rick Wagner interacted with his clients, he saw children and teenagers who also turned their fury outward, becoming violent and predatory. He argued that “these children are as much the victims of black rage as those who turn it inward, except that they find ways to share their pain with society in a way that society does not like but for which it refuses to accept any responsibility.”\nThe Noble Drew housing project is an example of existing racism. Unfortunately, as much of the public is unable to understand black poverty and crime as the result of past discrimination, it is therefore incumbent on lawyers defending children who have grown up in slum housing to expose the present-day racism. A black rage defense would show the intersection of greedy private landlords and an indifferent government that fails to enforce the tenants’ right to decent, safe housing.11 Whenever the government prosecutes a young person who has grown up in a place like Noble Drew, the government itself should be put on trial for its willful acceptance of the dehumanizing practices of slumlords. We can and must show how present-day racism warps these defendants just as racism in the 1940s deformed Bigger Thomas.\nSince the black rage defense is by definition a discussion of race set in an intensely emotional context, it is necessary for lawyers, legal workers, and defense committees to think through the social and philosophical ramifications of each case.\nThe different black rage cases analyzed in this book allow us to draw some conclusions about when the defense is appropriate and what elements give it the best chance of winning. The potential for the jury to empathize with the defendant should be an overriding concern, informing ",
