They regard the State of Israel not as a Messianic-eschatological event, but as simply another framework within which the people of Torah may live or not, as they choose.132 While they agree that it is a mizvah to live in the Holy Land, they insist on viewing this mizvah within the perspective of the ancient commentaries as if there were no State and no ingathering. Indeed, in their view, the Jewishness of the secularists and the socialists who control the government of Israel is so woefully attenuated as to border on the meaningless. The Torah—and the Torah alone—is the sole yardstick of belonging to the “people of God.” The Messianic-eschatological State is one in which the Torah is the constitution, the Holy Temple is brought down from heaven or built up, the Sanhedrin is reconstituted with the help of the Holy Spirit, and the Messiah is revealed. All else belongs to the historical world, where the loyal remnant of the meta-historical people must make do, waiting for the coming of the Promised One.\nThe moderate Orthodox (Mizrahi, or Religious National Party, or the modern Orthodox in the Diaspora) assume that the concept of Israel is bipolar, national, and secular as well as religious and fundamentalist. They participate in the government of Israel, recognizing the Jewishness of all ethnic Jews who have not broken away from the fold officially and flagrantly. They regard the State of Israel as the “beginning of the growth of our redemption.” They look upon the present situation as the twilight between the night of exile and the day of Messianic redemption, the borderland between history and meta-history. They have not given up the hope for the fullness of redemption, but they feel that its course must not be plotted in advance.133 Hence, it is the duty of all Jews to work for the upbuilding of the land, the ingathering of the exiles, and the sovereignty of Torah within the limits of a modern state. They waver between the teaching that it is a meritorious deed for a Jew to settle in Israel and the doctrine that it is the bounden duty of a Jew to live in the land of Israel. This indecision is due only in part to practical considerations; essentially, it is a reflection of the feelings of tension between the compulsions of our temporal existence and the claims of the meta-historical realm that is even now taking shape. Were not the excesses of twentieth-century anti-Semitism, culminating in the Nazi “final solution,” precisely the “pains of the Messiah” that the ancient tradition foretold? Was not the flight of the Arabs from Israel in ",
