            "pageText": "Rhetorical Strategies as Ideology\nSince the publication of Gayspeak in 1981, some rhetorical critics have increasingly asked whether or not rhetorical criticism itself must always and necessarily be a reflection of the ideology of the rhetorical critic.19 Other rhetorical critics have asked whether or not rhetorical strategies themselves are ideologically neutral tools that can be used for either good or evil and can therefore be used in support of any number of rhetorical and political positions. Christine Oravec, for example, has suggested that the autobiography, as a rhetorical form, may possess a gender-based “ideological quality” that “inscribes in its very form the ideology of the self-made man; the strong, autonomous leader; the self-interested investor; the search of the secular soul for ultimate reward and fulfillment.”20\nThis concern for rhetorical form as ideology constitutes an important feature of any rhetorical critic’s analysis. The discovery of a dominant, if not governing, rhetorical form suggests the existence of a sociopolitical program, even if that program is unconsciously advocated. Similarly, the discovery of a dominant or governing rhetorical form implies that the rhetorical critic assess the viability of the sociopolitical program sought by a rhetor.\nIn this commentary, I lack the space to suggest how rhetorical forms and strategies might be systematically linked to political positions.21 Moreover, my intent at this juncture is only to highlight the findings and consequences of the choices made by the rhetorical critics in Part One. In this regard, I am convinced that the objects of study of each of these rhetorical critics and the rhetorical form they have discovered reflect potential ideological directions for how the discourse of gay males and lesbians should be formulated. The issues can be aptly summarized in a series of questions raised by the three essays we have been examining: Can gay males and lesbians realize their objectives through concerted legal efforts? Can gay males and lesbians realize their objectives through concerted political campaigns? Can gay males and lesbians realize their objectives outside of the moral scheme of the larger sociopolitical system?\nThere are no easy answers to these questions, for the questions themselves conceal more than they reveal. It remains unclear, for example, if gay males and lesbians can be treated as a cohesive social unit. Even if one assumes that gay males and lesbians function as a single and cohesive unit, it remains unclear if one or many objectives govern the lifestyle concerns ",
