            "pageText": "lawyer who had done volunteer civil rights work with the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee in Mississippi in 1964, and in the ensuing years had built a well-respected law firm in Boston. In the Gilchrist case, his cocounsels were Robert Johnson, Jr., and Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree, who had a distinguished career as a public defender, private practitioner, and law professor.\nThe defense was insanity under Massachussetts law, which was the same as the federal rule during the Witherspoon case. The defense’s diagnosis was that Gilchrist was suffering from a long-term paranoid personality disorder and committed the homicide during a brief reactive psychosis. As jury selection began the defense persuaded Judge John Irwin, Jr., to question each juror carefully and individually as to race prejudice. During the voir dire one prospective juror finally admitted that there had been talk at his job among the white employees that since the defendant was black, “he would get away with it.” The juror said that he could not overcome his own racial prejudice and was excused. Ultimately, a jury of nine whites and three blacks was seated. Of the twelve jurors, nine were women.\nAs in all well-prepared insanity cases, the childhood and life history of the defendant was presented. Lonnie Gilchrist, Jr., grew up in the projects in the South End section of Boston. He was the oldest of seven, all of whom succeeded educationally. Zalkind described them as a “proud family, a family that’s going to get themselves out of the disadvantages of poverty, of the projects.”\nGilchrist’s father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and the children. When Gilchrist was a teenager he took a baseball bat and, with the help of his brother, stopped his father from beating their mother. But the years had left scars and created a feeling of powerlessness that haunted him his whole life. Nevertheless, he did have numerous successes while growing up. He had a high IQ and was a good student and athlete at Brighton High School, where he had friends of all races. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts and earned a postgraduate degree from the prestigious Wharton School of Business. But for all his intelligence and education, he did not succeed in his career. After losing several jobs, he moved back into his little room at his mother’s house in the projects. According to his friends and family and the psychiatrists who evaluated him, he was preoccupied with racism and blamed it for his work failures. ",
