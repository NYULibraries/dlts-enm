There is a coordinated labor market where trade unions have retained much of their historical importance, and key actors are encouraged “to engage in collective discussion and reach agreements with each other” (Hall and Soskice 2001, 11).\nBased on the aforementioned classifications, the Nordic Model appears as either a specific type of society or as a subcategory of a broader corporatist model. In both cases, the Nordic system is often referred to as social democratic, thereby implying a high degree of egalitarianism and universalism. The system has been created with a transformative agenda, in which the ambition has not been to preserve differences of class and status, as in other corporatist countries, but to enroll everybody in the same social security and welfare state provisions, which encourage participation and inclusion of all citizens in the political and cultural public spheres. Within the mixed and open economies, public elements remain strong, and deliberation and coordination are encouraged in both the economy and elsewhere. As pointed out by Hall and Soskice: “Nations with a particular type of coordination in one sphere of the economy (. . .) tend to develop complementary practices in other spheres as well” (18).\nThe Nordic Model is generally described in rather positive terms and is often held out as an ideal, both inside and outside the region. This raises the issue of glorification: to what degree does the model present a romanticized version of life in the Nordic countries, glossing over difficult questions and internal tensions in order to create a global brand? In 2008, the Nordic Council of Ministers invited five international writers to cast a critical look at the Nordic Model, several of which address the issue of ideals vs. reality. Marie-Laure Le Foulon, a French journalist specializing in Nordic affairs, titles her contribution “Homo Nordicus, A Paradoxical Figure” and observes: “Living among the Nordics is like living with walking guilt complexes” (19). Although fascinated by the Nordic countries, which she sees as “clean” and “green” (25), she notes that life here “can be miserable” and cites “sporadic drinking bouts” and “unfathomable sadness” as features of the Nordic character.\n“High suicide rates, binge drinking and a lack of social relations” is also cited as a Nordic characteristic by Spanish journalist Anxo Lamela Conde (2008, 55). Charles Ferro, an American author and journalist, titles his contribution “A Fragile Creature That Needs Care” and refers to the reactions he gets among Americans when he cites the Nordic taxation rate, “madness” and “a nightmare” (47). With a slight ironic twist, German foreign correspondent Siegfried Thielbeer asks: is the Nordic region a cozy and peaceful society? reminding us that for Social Democrats and Socialists in Germany, as elsewhere, the Nordic societies symbolized “the realization of the old dreams of the working class” for many years. People of the Nordic countries were generally\n",
