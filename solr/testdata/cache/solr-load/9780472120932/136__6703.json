It closes by considering two final topics that are essential to prospects for interdisciplinarity in Digital Humanities: collaboration and a culture of recognition. The chapter begins by defining characteristics of interdisciplinary collaboration, common problems, dynamics of integration in trading zones of expertise, the role of conflict and mutual learning, interdisciplinary work practices, and an ethics of collaboration. It then identifies parallels in efforts to legitimate interdisciplinary and digital scholarship and teaching in the academic reward system, countering impediments with authoritative guidelines for equitable inclusion. The chapter closes by returning to the question that prompted this book in the first place: Is Digital Humanities an interdisciplinary field? Three concepts come together in a final answer. A triple efficacy is unfolding across the “circuit of work” that constitutes the field: across disciplines, interdisciplinary fields, and professions; within and across their institutional locations; and within and across all organizations and groups that are grappling with implications of the digital and new media. Individuals and teams are leveraging change through a plurality of “strategic tractions” in particular contexts that have, at the same time, multiplicative effects in the “network aggregate university” of Digital Humanities.\nCollaboration\nCollaboration is not a typical mode of work in humanities. It occurs, and many believe teamwork is a necessity in Digital Humanities. Yet, the legacy of the lone scholar persists. The literature on interdisciplinary collaboration grew exponentially over the past several decades because of the heightened profile of teams in science-based fields of international competition, including biomedicine and pharmaceuticals, computer sciences, manufacturing, and high technology. Interdisciplinary collaboration is also a prominent focus in the Science of Team Science network and in transdisciplinary research on complex problem solving. John Unsworth cautions against adopting structural models from science, since the size, scale, and needs of humanities projects differ (Unsworth and Tupman, 232). Yet, DH teams face similar challenges, so can benefit from comparative understanding of insights in the wider literature on interdisciplinary collaboration.\n",
