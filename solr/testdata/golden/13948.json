If only 20 or 30 percent of a company’s stock ever comes onto the market, this inadequate supply naturally pushes up the price. Because of these high prices, the common international yardstick, the price/earnings ratio, was excessively high in Japan, and nowhere else.

They must raise performance levels and increase dividends because American stockholders will not wait patiently for results.
