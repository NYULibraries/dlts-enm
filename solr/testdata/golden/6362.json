When I asked Jim Roberts, assistant managing editor, why no one had anything to say about the Web during Page One meetings, he responded this way:\n \nPrint is still the medium of choice. Still, the vast majority of people [the audience] take their cues from print. What we do in print is more symbolic and more permanent than your home page, which can be erased and altered in a handful of keystrokes…. It's not like they are not paying attention. It's just that I take it as a compliment that the executive editor rarely tells me that I have overplayed or underplayed a story.\nIt has happened, but it doesn't happen that often. We go into that meeting and in the version of the meeting held the Web site is displayed in larger-than-life fashion. If someone had an issue, I'm pretty sure I would hear about it. I think some of it is just a matter of just their own interest, and some of it is a matter that they seem to think that we are doing okay.7\n \nThis comment was worth highlighting because Roberts, who was charged with leading Web efforts, acknowledged the dominant cultural role of print. Even though he was in charge of the Web, he still thought that top editors were still more interested in print. Roberts' response also suggested a theme we'll see throughout this chapter: the Web site was simply left alone to a set of people in the newsroom who were charged with taking care of it—and in the end, the rhythms of print and Web could not be truly integrated. It was okay not to focus on the Web, because everyone charged with its production was doing a good enough job that it didn't need the attention of Page One; the Web was running smoothly on its own terms in the background. The focus on Page One by top editors emphasizes a focus on tomorrow's news, not today's news—what immediacy for newspapers used to mean before online journalism.\nPublisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr. has been fairly quick to say in public that The New York Times could be imagined as a digital-only publication. “We will stop printing The New York Times, sometime in the future, date TBD,” he told a London audience.8 However, many at\n",
