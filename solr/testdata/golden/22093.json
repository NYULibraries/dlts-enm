See Habermas, Between Facts and Norms, esp. chaps. 1 and 2.\n52. See, for instance, Ernst Tugendhat, “Habermas on Communicative Action,” in his Philosophische Aufsätze (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1992), 433; and Cheryl Misak, “Pragmatism and the Transcendental Turn in Truth and Ethics,” Transactions of the C.S. Peirce Society 30 (1994): 739.\n53. The internal account is largely inspired by the work of the Weimar public lawyer and political theorist Hermann Heller. See his Gesammelte Schriften, 2d ed., 3 vols. (Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1992). I discuss Heller’s work in detail in “Hermann Heller and the Legitimacy of Legality,” Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 16 (1996): 641; and Legality and Legitimacy: Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, and Hermann Heller in Weimar (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997).\n54. H. L. A. Hart, “Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals,” in Hart, Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), 53–54, 74–75.\n55. See, for example, H. L. A. Hart, “Comment,” in R. Gavison, ed., Issues in Contemporary Legal Philosophy: The Influence of H. L. A. Hart (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), 35, 36–40.\n56. Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law, rev. ed. (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1969), 204. For an attempt of this kind, one much influenced by both Heller and Habermas, see Wolfgang Schluchter, The Rise of Western Rationalism: Max Weber’s Developmental History, trans. and intro. G. Roth (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985).\n57. There is, I think, an interesting shift in positivist legal theory between Jeremy Bentham and the present—from Bentham’s emphasis on the conscience of the democratic citizen to the contemporary emphasis on the liberal citizen. To emphasize the conscience of the liberal citizen is in effect to put the judge at the center of things, since the guardians of liberal political morality are judges.\n58. Rawls, Political Liberalism, 10.\n59. I rely here on the excellent treatment of this issue by Mayo Moran, “Talking about Hate Speech: A Rhetorical Analysis of American and Canadian Approaches to the Regulation of Hate Speech,” Wisconsin Law Review 6 (1994): 1425; and on my own work on the freedom of expression: “John Stuart Mill and the Harm of Pornography,” Ethics 102 (1992): 534; and “Pornography and Public Reason,” Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence 7 (1994): 261.\n60.
