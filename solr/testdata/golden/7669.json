            "pageText": "ers showed him how to do this online and these are obviously unpaid for—unlike Max or Dominic. He puts the music on his phone. At several points in the conversation he used music from the phone to make this point. He does not use music as background mood but listens to it actively. He clearly knows all the words to the songs that he played me and these are important—we talked about this—but he refused to sing along for me. He does use YouTube tutorials and he talked about learning where to put his fingers.19\nHe has a strategy of how to deal with frustrations when he cannot get it correct and a way of pretending to play to an audience in order to be explicit to himself about what he’s doing. For the most part he is left alone playing on the sofa. At one stage I did ask him to bring down the acoustic guitar. He finds this more difficult as the neck and frets are more physically demanding. He was happy on the un-amplified electric. He clearly hears the music in his head. At this stage he does have a notion of progression, of improving himself and some sense of the repertoire he would like to be able to play. He did play me a few riffs—his own composition—but was by no means overly ambitious about wanting to be a songwriter. At the moment playing other people’s music accurately is what he wants to do.\nAs with Giselle, Fesse’s interest was driven by his taste, which came across as a form of deep cultural attention. This was part of his distinctive individual confidence, a sense of taking himself seriously—imagined as a future musician—which enabled him to transform this pastime into a serious educational project. The strategies he had developed, pretending to perform to an audience, repeating, using tutorials, and so forth, may have been drawn from school-based experiences. But he demonstrated a mature ownership of these processes that was not—or perhaps could not be—exercised at school, where the teacher generally retained authority over learning in the classroom.\nConclusions\nIn different ways and for different reasons, Max, Giselle, Sedat, and Fesse exemplified an energy, drive, and enthusiasm as they began to exert independence in relation to their music making and music learning.
