She can’t do it as good as the guy ’cause she’s just a girl.” And like we’re trying to break that stereotype and all that.46\n\nThe perceived lack of authenticity of female DJs means that DOSE DJs not only have to deal with skepticism regarding their DJ skills but also lack of financial remuneration relative to their male counterparts.\nYet DOSE members are also well aware of the novelty of women DJs, and thus they make a concerted effort to capitalize on the masculinist orientation of DJing by redeploying and rearticulating their sexuality in strategic ways. As One Tyme notes, several DOSE DJs don revealing clothing as a way to bring attention to the group, secure gigs, and attract a large following or audience. In this respect, then, the decision of some group members to dress provocatively may very well help the group achieve prominence in the field of DJing.

It was, like, a lot of girls from the projects, not necessarily Filipino. A lot of them were black and Latina. So we did that.47\n\nAs some of the few female DJs in the culture, several of my female respondents have made it a point to do whatever they can to help female youth get into DJing, as they are fully cognizant of the difference mentorship makes particularly for aspiring female DJs.\nThrough their efforts to carve out a niche within DJ culture, Pinay DJs have opened up new possibilities for aspiring women DJs, legitimizing the involvement of women in DJing and broadening the range of femininities articulated in DJing. More specifically, Pinay DJs enact and perform an alternative kind of femininity that, to use Norma Mendoza-Denton’s words, “not only confounds wider community notions of how girls should act, dress, and talk, ",
