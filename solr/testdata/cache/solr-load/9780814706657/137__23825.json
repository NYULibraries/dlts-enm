We do not know it in any pure way; we infer its presence from our ability to manipulate the world for satisfaction.\nOur imagined reality, the one we talk about in language, is a map of human possibility imagined by the ego. It is indeed influenced by the Real, but it is also influenced by all the learned beliefs and social codes (fictions) arbitrarily manufactured by culture and the idiosyncrasies of personal development. Because the ego is formed as an interaction between the Real and social reality, it is allied not only to the Real, but also to the fictional components of social reality.\nThis has important theoretical consequences. In being allied to the fictional components of social reality, the ego will often, against its own self-interest, seek to deny the Real and affirm the fictional truth of an idealization—of a purely imagined reality—even when such “truth” is a fiction that blocks its ability to gain satisfaction from the Real.\nIn this case, all possible representation for the Real suffers repression. Under repression, however, aspects of the Real can be brought forward into consciousness through the distorting power of primary process thinking. The Real thus becomes paradoxically linked to processes traditionally seen as the epitome of “unrealistic forces.” Through the expressive power of restless narcissistic forces seeking to name something that is needed and missing, the Real can achieve provisional or fragmentary modes of experimental representation—but only through opposition to the functions that ideally “map” and represent it.\nThrough a deformation of ego-approved representational structures, primary processes can give rise to imagery that can provide new categories for conceiving new signifieds. Often enough, however, this process can be enormously disorienting for the self. This is true because the ego finds its own map of reality very secure and comfortable. From such a perspective, any changes proposed for “reality” (the imagery of repressed cognition) can seem hallucinatory, fictional, and disorienting. In addition, because the Real is partially disclosed as a potential signified through narcissistic forces already closely associated with projection, hallucination, and disorientation, its provisional signifieds (signifieds frequently present, as I have suggested earlier, in the form of “images”) may seen especially unhealthy and surreal.\nD. M. Thomas’s White Hotel offers a fitting illustration of these events. In the novel Lisa Erdman comes to Sigmund Freud suffering from severe pains in her left breast and pelvic region and a chronic ",
