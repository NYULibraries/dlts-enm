Littell has noted, the evolving “American pattern of ‘separation’ had its origin in the adjustments to the interaction of religion and politics that were unique to America.”29 The separationist principle was an American invention, as was the Jeffersonian metaphor of a “wall” between church and state, around which so much recent constitutional and Jewish public debate has revolved. The position Herberg espoused was predicated on the argument that the authors of the Constitution never intended to erect an impenetrable “wall of separation.” Although the Founding Fathers did not want to favor any single religion, they were not against helping all religions, or all religion, equally. “Neither in the minds of the Founding Fathers nor in the thinking of the American people through the nineteenth and into the twentieth century,” he wrote, “did the doctrine of the First Amendment ever imply an ironclad ban forbidding the government to take account of religion or to support its various activities.” In the last years, this argument has been advanced with greater confidence than it was earlier; outside the legal community, Herberg was one of the first American intellectuals to articulate it.\nBefore most American Jewish intellectuals, Herberg called for a reassessment of the prevailing liberal Jewish consensus concerning the sharply delimited role that religion should play in American public life. In several articles published during the 1950s and 1960s, Herberg urged the Jewish establishment to reassess this position. “By and large,” he wrote in 1952, those who speak for the American Jewish community\nseem to share the basic secularist presupposition that religion is a “private matter.” … The American Jew must have sufficient confidence in the capacity of democracy to preserve its pluralistic … character without any absolute wall of separation between religion and public life. … The fear felt by Jewish leaders of the possible consequences of a restoration of religion to a vital place in public life is what throws them into an alliance with the secularists and helps make their own thinking so thoroughly secular.30\nA decade or so later, frustrated by Jewish support for the 1963 Supreme Court decisions banning the Lord’s Prayer and Bible reading in the public schools, he entered a plea for a restoration of religion to a place of honor in American life:\n",
