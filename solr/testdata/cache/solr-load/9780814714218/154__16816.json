Neither Arrow nor Sen dismisses the appeal of socialism.\n5. For some evidence that most Americans, rich and poor alike, remain reluctant to abandon capitalism in principle despite their discontent at the pronounced degree of inequality found in the modern American economy, see Jennifer L. Hochschild, What’s Fair? American Beliefs about Distributive Justice (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981); Robert E. Lane, “Market Justice, Political Justice,” American Political Science Review 80 (1986): 383-402; and Herbert McClosky and John Zaller, The American Ethos: Public Attitudes Towards Capitalism and Democracy (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985). On American atitudes toward individualism, see also Robert N. Bellah et al. Habits of the Heart (New York: Harper \u0026 Row, 1985), esp. 142-63. It should be noted that the actual U.S. economy is what might be termed “mixed welfare state capitalism,” i.e., a welfare state (redistributive taxation) and elements of socialism (public ownership of productive assets) are combined with the predominant emphasis on capitalism.\n6. Jeffrey G. Williamson and Peter H. Lindert claim in their American Inequality (New York: Academic Press, 1980) that U.S. experience confirms the well-known Kuznets hypothesis. Kuznets hypothesized that economic growth produces first an increase then a decrease in inequality as average incomes rise. See Simon Kuznets, “Economic Growth and Income Inequality,” American Economic Review 45 (1955): 1-28. See also Jeffrey G. Williamson, “Is Inequality Inevitable Under Capitalism? The American Case,” in Modern Capitalism, ed. P. L. Berger (London: Hamilton Press, 1987), 1: 48-83.\n7.

For discussion, see Hochschild, What’s Fair? 3-6; Lars Osberg, Economic Inequality in the United States (Armonk, N.Y.: M. E. Sharpe, 1984); and Williamson and Lindert, American Inequality, 65—95. It should be noted that the overall distributional impact of the complex and ever-changing tax system is difficult to assess. See, for example, Lester C. Thurow, The Zero-Sum Society (New York: Penguin, 1981), 167-77; and Thurow, The Zero-Sum Solution (New York: Simon \u0026 Schuster, 1985), 110-31,207-61.\n9.
