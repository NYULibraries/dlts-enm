The boys commonly referred to having “associates,” and these “associates” were commonly given such titles because they were not considered trustworthy enough to be called “friends.”\nIn his sophomore year, Malcolm says in response to Mike’s questions concerning whether or not he has a close or best friend:\nNo, right now, I don’t know, I don’t like to be crowded too much. No … just my girlfriend really. I be chilling with her, but besides that I’m getting tired of being crowded really …\nWhat exactly do you mean be being crowded?\nWell, it could just be one person. But sometimes that one person just get aggravating. Not what he says and stuff, it’s just that he’s being—that he’s there. ’Cause it’s just most of the time I like to be alone, you know, just me and my dark side … but I don’t like people always around me and stuff.\nWith not much affect in his voice, Malcolm expresses little interest in having a close or best male friend and, in fact, claims to feel uncomfortable with his male peers. When he discusses his girlfriend, however, his desires concerning male friendships become more complicated than this dismissive attitude initially suggests:\nWith my girlfriend, I could relax … we could do certain things that you can’t—you don’t—well you can do it [with male friends] but it’s just not the same feeling like when you’re walking with a girl because with a girl you can express certain feelings, and stuff … you can talk about certain things. … [With boys] it’s just harder to like … ’cause some of the things you may [want to do] make you seem as if you’re gay or something. … It’s more relaxing when you’re with a girl so you can just chill. Seems like you have more to talk about.\nAlthough Malcolm may desire intimate male friendships (“where you can express certain things”), he seems to find them too risky (“makes you seem as if you’re gay”). Instead, he chooses to spend intimate time with his girlfriend ",
