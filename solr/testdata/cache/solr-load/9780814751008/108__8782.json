            "pageText": "those of the evolutionary folklorists, whose bases for the interpretation of folk narratives were discredited for several reasons. Rather naively the evolutionists assumed that story motifs reflected actual customs: if the bride in an animal groom story had her eyes sealed during marriage to a beast, it must have been because at one time actual brides in that society married with blindfolds.31 Not only was the assumption unproven and often simplistic, but, as noted in the introduction, a very important element in the fantasy at the heart of animal groom and animal bride stories is freedom from cultural necessity, the tension between an attachment to reality, which involves roots in society, and an imagined flight from it. But it was also the idea of the childhood of fiction, with its concomitant idea of a childish culture that was eventually rejected, although later folklorists often threw the baby out with the bathwater. Certainly with regard to fairy tales, and particularly the folklore of animal brides and grooms, these early critics supplied insights that should not be ignored. Their attempt to match a story to the people who told it, moreover, was a move in the direction of the cultural specificity demanded by many folklorists today, although—again—animal bride and groom tales often reflect a symbolic rejection of life as actually lived. Still, a brief look at some specifically described practices that closely match features of the Cupid and Psyche tales suggests correctives not only to Neumann’s analysis but also to one that is today even better known, the interpretation of the animal groom cycle in Bruno Bettelheim’s The Uses of Enchantment.\nIn notes to a poem based on American Indian lore, Henry Whiting describes a supposedly “common form of courtship,” in which\nthe inamorato goes at the hour of midnight, and lights a small torch by the embers of the wigwam fire. With this he approaches the spot where the object of his visit lies slumbering, or seems to be so. If she blows it out, it is a sign that his visit is agreeable; if not, he takes the hint, and retires.32\nWith greater authority, Keigo Seki invokes a similar custom to explain the widely told Japanese serpent bridegroom story, in which a mysterious lover’s nightly visits to a woman end in a catastrophe when she attaches a thread to his clothing and follows it to his daytime abode, often to find a snake dead of the needle that she unwittingly had thrust into his skin. According to Seki, a young Japanese man could at one time steal at night into a girl’s room without her parents being aware of ",
