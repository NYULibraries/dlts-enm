Thus, the meaning of a metaphor (or symbol) is not a subjective judgment on the part of the reader, but can be arrived at by applying objective criteria, based on an understanding of the human intellect. The argument for the universality of symbols and metaphors establishes the timeless quality of linguistic expression, and renders the Bible and Talmuds as comprehensible, in their own terms, to someone in the nineteenth century as they were to their original audiences. Once this point has been established, the way is open for an exegetical reconstruction of Jewish faith that will alleviate the perplexities of the traditional intellectual for whom Krochmal is writing.\nKrochmal’s interpretive method may be seen as a middle ground between the methods of interpreting sacred documents of Maimonides and Spinoza. For the former, prophecy, for example, represents a certain perfection in the nature of the human being, in addition to its dependence on the will of God.44 The prophets, and, for that matter, the sages, are men of speculative insight, who speak in parables specifically designed to conceal the meaning of their words from those whom they might otherwise mislead.45 Thus, for Maimonides, the biblical and rabbinic authors can be seen as philosophers who spoke in parables and riddles. For Spinoza, on the other hand, there can be no relationship between the content of philosophy and theology at all. The role of the latter is simply to instill beliefs necessary for obedience; those beliefs are far inferior to the insights of speculative philosophy, or ",
