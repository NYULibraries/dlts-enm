            "pageText": " were worthy of most men’s trust. Federalists argued that natural aristocrats were trustworthy leaders and lawmakers. They were family men loath to engage in actions that might harm their posterity and gentlemen whose jealousy of their reputations allied them to the public good. Antifederalists contended that natural aristocrats, like all men, were flawed beings. Samuel Bryan claimed that they had a “love of domination” in proportion to their “talents, abilities, and superior acquirements.” Even those with “the greatest purity of intention” were apt to become “instruments of despotism in the hands of the artful and designing.” Unfortunately, the public was often blind to their failings and yielded “an implicit assent to the opinions of those characters whose abilities are held in the highest esteem.” Some antifederalists suggested that the “illustrious” were no “more free from error” than common men but were more insensitive to people of modest means. Other antifederalists repeated the warning that the public was sometimes so “dazzled by the splendor of names as to run blindfolded into what may be our destruction.”31\nMost federalists and antifederalists did agree that Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and other framers of the Constitution were natural aristocrats. Federalists argued that these “distinguished worthies” favored ratification and the common man who respected them ought to favor ratification too, as well as “manfully oppose” those whose “wicked intent” was to destroy these great men’s labors. Noah Webster emphasized that “some of the greatest men in America with the venerable FRANKLIN and the illustrious WASHINGTON at their head” had written the Constitution. They deserved public support. James Madison recognized that the framers’ reputations were crucial to ratification: “Had the Constitution been framed by an obscure individual instead of the body possessing public respect and confidence, there can be no doubt that... it would have commanded little attention from most of those who now admire its wisdom.”32\nAntifederalists did not attack Franklin and Washington for being aristocrats. At times, they even congratulated the American public on its propensity to honor these great men by associating their good names with worthy deeds. The main opposition tactic was to stress individual men’s responsibility to make independent judgments about the Constitution while pointing out the framers’ flaws. Thomas Wait explained that, initially, “I loved George Washington—I venerated Benjamin Franklin—and therefore concluded that I must love and venerate all the works of their hands.” Soon, Wait realized that blind veneration was a “violence of passion” more appropriate to “European slaves” than to “the freemen of America.” He consulted manly “candor,” engaged in “cool and impartial examination,” and chose to oppose the Constitution. But why did America’s great men support the Constitution? Bryan reminded readers",
