If, then, in the past, Israel served as “a prophet unto the nations,” why not in the future?—The fact that this self-image entailed the anguish of martyrdom and the aura of dedication to the service of all men kept this doctrine from turning narrowly chauvinistic and narcissistic. Furthermore, with the rise of romantic nationalism in the modern world, the Halevian approach was rendered the flattery of imitation by such popular “prophets” as Fichte, Mazzini, Mickiewicz, Danilevski and Dostoevski. Ethnic mysticism proved to be fantastically contagious.\nEven the builders of classical Reform and cultural Zionism succumbed to the seduction of Halevian racism. Geiger, with all his rationalism, based his Jewish theology, especially his concept of Israel’s “mission,” on the axiom of an innate Jewish “genius” for religion. A’had Ha’am believed that “the national ethnic” and “the national soul” were all but atrophied when the people of Israel was uprooted and driven into exile and that with the return of Jews to their native land Israel’s ancient genius would be revived and revitalized.

The quest of truth is not a national monopoly It is man qua man that is the subject of all speculations about God. To limit “the divine manifestation” to Jews living in the land of Israel is as unworthy of Jews as it is destructive of the principle of human equality, which is affirmed in the Mishna. To be sure, in his letter to the Jews of Yemen, M. found it necessary to descend to the level of popular mythology and to argue that those who are descended from the men and women that stood at Sinai cannot possibly disbelieve in the promises of the Torah. However, in his “Guide,” he does not restrict prophecy either to the land of Israel or to the people of Israel. The reason prophecy is not attained in the lands of exile is due to the wretchedness of life in those countries. (II, 36.) And in a famous chapter (III, 51) he ranks the philosophical saints of all nations ahead of “Talmudists” and mizvah- observers. Also, in the well ",
