            "pageText": "Can we describe and define the parental figure of childhood fantasy which Rilke projected onto Rodin? In doing so, I shall avail myself of Heinz Kohut’s insights. In The Analysis of the Self (1971) and The Restoration of the Self (1977), Kohut studies forms of what he calls narcissistic illness in which “the self has not been solidly established,” with the consequence that “its cohesion and firmness depend on the presence of a self-object (or the development of a self-object transference).”2 By “self-object” Kohut means “objects which are themselves experienced as part of the self,” as the mother is in infancy. These are “archaic objects cathected with narcissistic libido ... which are still in intimate connection with the archaic self” of infancy and early childhood. One such “archaic self-object,” according to Kohut, is the highly idealized image of the parent as an omnipotent, perfect figure, which the “archaic self” is motivated to create partly by its need to preserve its own primitive narcissism and omnipotence by sharing in the idealized parent’s power and perfection. The archaic self can feel all-powerful, lovable, and valuable in its fantasy of unity with this highly idealized parental figure. Hence, as Kohut argues, its idealization of the parent is narcissistic, the motivational energy comes from the infant’s need for omnipotence, love, and self-esteem. According to Kohut, a child or an adult experiences another person from the perspective of narcissistic feelings and fantasies when the “expected control over such (self-object) others is ... closer to the concept of the control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than he expects to have over others.”3\nKohut traces the extreme idealization of other people by adults suffering from what he calls narcissistic illness back to the beginnings of mental-emotional development in infancy. Very early in our lives, he says, “after being exposed to the disturbance of the psychological equilibrium of primary narcissism, the psyche saves a part of the lost experience of global narcissistic perfection to an archaic, rudimentary (transitional) self-object, the idealized imago.” At this stage of development, “all power and bliss reside in the idealized object.” Consequently, “the child feels empty and powerless when he is separated from it and he attempts, therefore, to maintain continuous union with it.”4 Adults afflicted with narcissistic illness suffer from this infantile experience of emptiness and powerlessness in the absence of a surrogate for the “idealized parent imago.” Rilke felt unreal, and he was plagued by self-doubt, uncertainty, self-division, and childhood fears in those early days in Paris.
