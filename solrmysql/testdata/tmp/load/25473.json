            "pageText": "there is no commandment imposing any beliefs on the Israelites. The dignity of man consists in his freedom to seek truth and to distinguish between good and evil. Man cannot surrender his intelligence and his conscience without ceasing to be human. Man’s freedom is “the image of God” within him. Even God does not intrude into the inner sanctuary of man’s soul. According to the Talmud, “everything is in the power of heaven, save the fear of heaven” (Berochot 33b). How could He, Who is the Source of Wisdom and Goodness, restrict and frustrate the faculties of the human personality by making salvation dependent on quasi-magical formulae?29\nIt follows that although Judaism adds non-rational ceremonies to the Religion of Reason, these “external” mizvot are not indispensable for salvation. Christianity, or Christian theology, in all its orthodox forms is essentially irrational. It may still serve as a Religion of Reason for its own constituents, who, as they become philosophers, modify its dogmas privately in order to preserve its essential, ethical-spiritual impetus. But official Christianity, glorying in its paradoxes, cannot serve in the same capacity, openly and universally—that is, in the Germany of Mendelssohn’s day—so long as it remains unreconstructed, weighted down by dogmas that the free mind of man utterly repudiates. To be sure, man’s reason points to its own limitations. Hence, “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom” (Ps. 3; 10). But although man acknowledges a transrational mystery, he cannot succumb to irrationalism without surrendering his freedom, his essential, human, and divine dignity.\nMendelssohn’s assertion that Judaism does not require the acceptance of beliefs was repeated throughout the nineteenth century by detractors as well as by defenders of the Jewish faith. The defenders pointed to Judaism’s essential rationality, while the detractors asserted that Judaism was not a religion at all, since it did not aim to achieve a mystical communion between God and Man, requiring only the rote performance of certain deeds.\nWe need to take account of the special context in which Mendelssohn’s argument was made. First, the Religion of Nature, to Mendelssohn, was a warm, full-blooded theism, in which the sentiments of the Psalmists acquired fresh and vibrant meaning—it is significant that Mendelssohn completed a sensitive translation of the Book of Psalms. Reason, to him, included that tissue of rational and moral arguments that leads to a firm assurance of the Divine Presence, of man’s immortality, of the role of Providence and the freedom of will.
