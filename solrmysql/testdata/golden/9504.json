Rather than one prisoner’s impressions, this diary records the decisions made and the guidelines set up by the group as a whole. As the reader will note, the diary is both cryptic and full of humor, revealing daily aspects that were not emphasized in the men’s narratives. The Red Cross reports add a new perspective, from observers of the captives in “real time.” All these documents are arranged chronologically, so that the reader can follow some of the developments in the group’s life.\nFROM THE DIARY\nIn a preliminary meeting which took place today, (February 19, 1971), it was decided to set up a council of ten members to discuss problems of the room and make decisions accordingly.\nThe decisions that were taken at the preliminary meeting:\n1. The council meets once a week on Friday after lights out.\n2. The chairman serves for one week.\n3. The chairmanship is assigned in alphabetical order of first names.\n4. A majority for decisions is six people.\n5. In case of a tie vote, the chairman has the power to decide.\n",
