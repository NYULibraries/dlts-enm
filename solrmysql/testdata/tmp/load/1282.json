            "pageText": "\nstudents were the most excited about using the wiki when it became clear to them that the resources and reflections that the entire community was assembling would be valuable throughout the remainder of the course. Their work on the wiki on days one and two would serve them on days four and five, so they had an incentive to participate in the wiki from the outset. One challenge, however, was that the perceived benefits seemed to disappear once the face-to-face community dispersed at the end of the course.\nBefore introducing the wiki itself, the instructor should design a basic structure for organizing its content, a structure that is typically seen by the learner as the front page. Creating a framework for the wiki not only seeds the community with some basic information and means for navigation but also helps set expectations concerning the kinds of tasks the wiki will support. In the SCIL Summer Institute, the framework simply consisted of the titles of the pages that were found in the wiki: course schedule, participant bios, useful links, images, and specific discussions. In contrast, in the Institute on Scholarship for Engineering Education (ISEE) Workshop, establishing the framework meant creating workspaces in the wiki for individual and small group work.\nOne of the more interesting things we found was that learners rarely changed the initial framework of the wiki. The wiki environment is unique in that any learner can change the navigation or reorganize the nature of the environment itself. This, however, rarely happened in the cases we studied (table 2). (See the online version of this chapter at www.digitalculture.org for additional figures.) In the ISEE Workshop wiki, while users were active in editing and creating pages, they were notably reluctant to edit the framework of the wiki shown in the right-hand column. We can speculate as to why this was the case. First, any tool that is introduced by an instructor is initially received as the property of the instructor and not necessarily a tool of the community. Because learners did not feel a sense of ownership over the wiki, they may have been reluctant to edit the pieces that they saw as fundamental to the environment itself. Second, users may have had a difficult time understanding that any changes made to the wiki could be easily reversed. Although this potential for “rollback” is central to the technology and philosophy of wikis as a tool, it is conceptually counterintuitive to the uninitiated. There may also have been some reluctance to change something that could affect every member of the community—in general, users were much more willing to add text rather than edit or delete existing text.\n",
