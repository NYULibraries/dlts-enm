            "pageText": "This scholarly activity, which spanned nearly half a century—beginning with his Harvard doctoral dissertation, which became his first book, Modern Philosophies of Judaism (1941)—covers an enormous historical and conceptual range, stretching from the biblical to the modern era. Nothing Jewish was alien to Agus, and his research and reflections involved talmudic, philosophical, and cabalistic sources, though quite clearly the philosophical material had pride of place.\nIn Modern Philosophies of Judaism, Agus undertook the task of explicating and criticizing the work of the great German Jewish thinkers Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, and Martin Buber—Cohen and Rosenzweig being little known in America at the time—as well as the radical theology of Mordecai Kaplan. Among this group of seminal thinkers, Agus was attracted most especially to the work of Franz Rosenzweig: “The spirit which permeates his work perforce escapes analysis. And that spirit is great and bright, glowing with the fire of God” (209). In particular, Agus was drawn to Rosenzweigs nonliteral, nonpropositional theory of revelation, which, he argued, “will be found to accord with an enlightened view of tradition and with the ways of thinking of the earnestly critical modern mind” (350). Cohen he found too abstract, his conception of God too distant from “the pattern of religious emotion” (126). Buber, whom Agus saw as a mystic, according to the criteria of mystical experience set out by William James,1 is criticized for his subjectivism—“Devotion uncontrolled by reason is a greater danger to society than selfishness, history proves abundantly. We find this truth scrawled all over the story of mankind, in letters of fire and blood” (276)—and for his rejection of rational, objective criteria in religious and ethical matters:\n\nThose of us, however, who are constrained to judge the value of these “inner calls” by external standards, may well feel uneasy at the total absence of the rational element in the decision advocated by Buber. If only we were certain that the call came from God! But, what if Satan should intervene instead! How are we to tell the voice of the “Eternal Thou” from that of the “demonic Thou?” (Is not Hitler, too, a mystic?)\n\nAlternatively, Kaplan, though described as a rationalist and a pragmatist, is found wanting because of internal contradictions within the structure of his thought, the inability “to develop [his] own conception of God to the point where it could serve as the basis of a life of religion” (315), ",
