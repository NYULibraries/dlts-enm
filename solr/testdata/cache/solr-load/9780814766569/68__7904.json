            "pageText": "Jake is alarmed by Joe at their first encounter, during his interview for a position at Wicomico State. Joe is “so bright, busy, and obviously on his way up” that Jake realizes “at once that the invidious comparisons to oneself that he could not for the life of him help inviting would prevent one’s ever being really tranquil about the fact of his existence” (ch. 2). Jake hits Joe “where he live[s]” by poking fun at his being a scoutmaster: inspiring a student, he says, is like “making fire with flint and steel.” Unlike the timorous Jake who had circled the drive several times because people were lounging on the front steps, Joe strides “cleanly across the lawn” when they part: “Apparently Joe Morgan was the sort who heads directly for his destination, implying by his example that paths should be laid where people walk, instead of walking where the paths happen to be laid.” We can see how Jake feels about this by his reaction to a student who challenges prescriptive grammar by arguing that grammar books just describe how people talk: “A Joe Morgan type, this lad: paths should be laid where people walk. I hated his guts” (ch. 10). Jake sets out “to rescue prescriptive grammar from the clutches of my impudent Mr. Blakesley, and, if possible, to crucify him in the process.”\nAfter they become friends, Jake attacks Joe indirectly, through Rennie. Joe and Rennie have an unusual relationship, the rules for which have been laid down by Joe. They are to do everything “on the same level, understanding it in the same way, for the same purpose, nobody making allowances for anybody else” (ch. 5). What one takes seriously, “both ought to be able to take seriously,” with their relationship first on the list. They are to make “heavy demands” on themselves and each other, and “they always [have] to be the same demands.” Since Joe can defend his ideas whereas Rennie cannot, Rennie throws out all her opinions and completely erases herself, “right down to nothing, so [she] can start over.” Rennie is Galatea to Joe’s Pygmalion; she tries desperately to be what he wants and would “rather be a lousy Joe Morgan than a first-rate Rennie MacMahon.” For reasons to be examined later, Joe wishes to expose Rennie to the influence of Jake, and he encourages them to go riding together while he works on his dissertation. It is during one of their rides that Jake begins to ridicule Joe and to subvert the Morgans’ relationship.\nJake begins by calling Joe “funny as hell” for hating pity and “silly” for getting upset at politeness (ch. 5). When Rennie becomes troubled and defensive, Jake presses the attack: “For that matter, what could be ",
