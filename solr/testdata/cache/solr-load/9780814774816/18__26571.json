            "pageText": "progressive project. The Toughs think oppression is immoral. Yet to many people their own agenda looks oppressive. They concede that their agenda involves bitter medicine, but they deny that it departs from their commitment to the dispossessed, claiming that it simply faces truth. They need this claim of truth to discipline a recalcitrant constituency and make it see its real best interests. But suppose their truth is a Trojan horse? The fact that many people doubt claims of objective truth creates an uneven playing field, to the disadvantage of the Tough Love Crowd. They speak on our behalf except they sound like our opponents. If their truths are ideological fetish, their love is rough self-pleasuring. And we be* more protected with their Trojan swords sheathed.35\n\n",
