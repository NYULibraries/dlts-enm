            "pageText": "Amendment rests upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respective sphere.”26\nThis Christian-derived bounded-spheres imagery also grounds the public/private dichotomy that is so central to religion clause cases. In this manifestation of the bounded spheres, the carnal and temporal realm becomes the public sphere of secular governmental action. The spiritual realm of Christian faith becomes the private sphere of individual religious action and salvation. In fact, quite often, the Court’s discourse in religion clause cases bolsters Christian cultural imperialism by construing or labeling oppressive Christian displays and revelries either as secular or as protected private sphere activities.27 When, for example, a particular activity is defined or coded as private—as separate from government—then the constitutional constraints imposed upon state actors are rendered irrelevant. This public/private dichotomy was crucial in Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, decided in 1995. The Court held that the display of a large Latin (Christian) cross on public property did not violate the establishment clause. The public property, a “state-owned plaza surrounding the Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio,” qualified as a traditional public forum because “[f]or over a century the square [had] been used for public speeches, gatherings, and festivals.” More important, though, the plurality opinion emphasized that a private actor, the Ku Klux Klan, and not the government had erected the cross: “[P]rivate religious expression receives preferential treatment under the Free Exercise Clause. It is no answer to say that the Establishment Clause tempers religious speech. By its terms that Clause applies only to the words and acts of government. It [does not impede] purely private religious speech.” Thus, even when the government must grant a permit to a speaker (as in Pinette), the constraints of the establishment clause do not apply; private actors remain free to disseminate their Christian messages on publicly owned property. In fact, quite predictably, after the district court issued an injunction permitting the Klan to erect its cross, the state “then received, and granted, several additional applications to erect crosses on [the public plaza].”28\nEmployment Division, Oregon Department of Human Resources v. Smith, when viewed in conjunction with Pinette, elucidates the intimate link between the public/private dichotomy and Christian societal domination. In holding that the compelling state interest test should not be used in most instances to adjudicate the constitutionality of laws of general applicability, the Court acknowledged that the religious majority occasionally might act through the legislative process to the disadvantage of religious minorities.\n",
