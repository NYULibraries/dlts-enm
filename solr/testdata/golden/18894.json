            "pageText": "similarities and differences in the great family of minds situated beyond borders. Civilization erected on the only right remaining to it, that of expressing itself, of disclaiming the blunders and downfalls, past and future, of those who cannot represent it.\nTo support oneself until such time as one can achieve recognition. To be “more than a town, a name.”49\nTo project those names that give a country and an era importance, that cause their energy to be released and their excellence to be proved. Let them speak since they alone can renew speech, can animate it, can make it durable, can stamp it on developing minds.\nLet’s save the tabernacle in which a people’s essence, its very supremacy, survives; let’s carry it through the deserts. Among our diversified duties, this one is, above all, sacrosanct; it is also the most self-serving. But it is difficult to include so lofty a selfishness among so many immediate ones.\nDid kings, who chose writers capable of prolonging and enhancing their royal prestige, did the patrons of the past, really know the wise speculation they were making?\nAre there still patrons for writers? Are we interested in them to the point of making it easier for them to stay alive so that their work may benefit? I question that vulnerable part of the being, that modern appendix of weights and measures, the leather wallet, the checkbook, which has certainly become the most sensitive and the most tended organ of the human make-up, though it is all too little human!\nIs there an elite capable of surrounding and protecting those who honor it? Are we still an active elite? Or is our admiration a sham, snobbism?\n“I would like so much to do something for the arts, for the talent of X.” Would that only be a ventriloquist’s cry coming from no one knows where?\nOr else are we a small sincere number of readers and writers joined together by the laws of exchange? Are we two indispensable parts of the one whole? And do we want the creative side, which is expressive of ourselves, to exist and be our spokesman?\n",
