As Shankar puts it, “some are born with identities, others have identities thrust on them.”\nIndira Karamcheti, English professor at Wesleyan University, is also concerned about the commodification of identity in the multicultural university. As a member of a non-American ethnic group teaching primarily white American students, Karamcheti has always been different from the students she teaches. As with many of the white faculty contributing to this volume, the challenges that have been posed to Karamcheti’s professional authority are a function of the phenomenological mismatch between her and her students; yet in her case, the grounds for those challenges have more to do with oldfashioned racism than contemporary identity politics. Karamcheti includes a number of passages from student papers that demonstrate the double bind of “non-Caucasian” teachers, who must contend ",
