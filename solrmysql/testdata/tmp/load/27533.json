            "pageText": "forth the double helical structure of DNA. A rapid series of later discoveries filled in the precise nature of the genetic code.\nThe discovery of the double helix is a classic example of the role of aesthetics in science: the double helix was an elegant structure, inspiring Watson to write that he and Crick were convinced that “a structure this pretty just had to exist.”11 A scientist cannot force the world to fit his image of beauty. But that image can inspire his efforts to find something that will later stand up—as the double helix did—to verification by others.\nThe discovery of the double helix also points up again the centrality of priority in the scientific endeavor, although it is an aspect of priority that is less attractive than the trio of researchers independently crediting Mendel’s earlier work. Priority can also mean winning a close race against someone you know is working in your area. Watson was aware that the great scientist Linus Pauling was also seeking to find the structure of DNA. When Watson, immediately after the discovery of the double helix, wrote to professor Max Delbrück about his breakthrough, he urged Delbrück not to tell Pauling:\nI was still slightly afraid something would go wrong and did not want Pauling to think about hydrogen-bonded pairs until we had a few more days to digest our position. My request, however, was ignored. Delbrück wanted to tell everyone in his lab…. Then there was the even more important consideration that Delbrück hated any form of secrecy in scientific matters.12\nWatson’s experience with the tension between priority and secrecy is typical. Trying to keep matters secret is, if nothing else, difficult. In the end, prompt publication is typically the best guarantee of priority.\nAs we have seen, the role of priority changes radically when one moves from science to law. Indeed, it is not simply a matter of crediting Brandeis rather than Cooley for the right to privacy because of the former’s greater eloquence and prestige. At times, coming in second is better for a judge or a lawyer. Being the first to confront an issue can happen by chance and a result initially reached often has to be amended in light of experience.\nConsider, for example, the admissibility in criminal trials of evidence from what has come to be called DNA typing.13 Apart from identical twins, any two people differ, albeit very slightly, in terms of their DNA. Criminals often leave behind hair follicles, blood stains, or other substances ",
