Equality was perhaps the one word most expressive of the Labor Zionist ideology: equality for Israel in the family of nations, equality for the Jews as an ethnic group in the United States, and equality as a social principle. In the end, despite the sincere commitment to the principle of Jewish communal strength, the commitment to social equality seemed to win out, leaving many of the Labor Zionists only a stone’s throw away from the civil rights positions advocated by the majority of liberal Jewish leaders.\nThe ambivalence of the Labor Zionists toward racial integration was demonstrated in the debate tripped off by an article published in 1964 by Marie Syrkin, “Can Minorities Oppose ‘De Facto’ Segregation?”155 In this controversial essay, Syrkin, the strong-minded daughter of the socialist Zionist theoretician Nachman Syrkin, argued that, except for avowed assimilationists, Jews had never made complete integration a goal and that the insistence of large segments of the Black community for complete integration posed a huge problem for American Jews.\nSpecifically, Syrkin explained that she had grown up in New York City in neighborhoods that were predominantly Jewish and had therefore attended predominantly Jewish public schools. While it was difficult to determine how much of this segregation was voluntary and how much forced, Jews never believed that the relative lack of gentiles in their presence was evidence of discrimination. Syrkin believed that in the Jews’ struggle to achieve greater economic, social, and educational mobility, the emphasis was almost always on better housing and better education, “not on the enforced presence of non-Jews on the premises.”156 Syrkin wrote extensively on American education systems for such liberal journals as Common Ground, the official journal of the Common Council for American Unity, but broke with many of her liberal colleagues by insisting that, if the schools reflected the population of the surrounding area and its residential distribution and the school board had not been found guilty of ",
