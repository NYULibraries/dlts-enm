Sometimes a discussion comes to an end, at which time it is easier to summarize it, but there is less motivation to do so. Discussions most need to be summarized when they get long, which usually means there are a lot of different opinions, making them hard to summarize.12\nThe concern is getting the synthesis wrong, especially thinking that you understand a point when you don't. However, the wiki is self-correcting: “Suppose I refactor a conversation and I (unknowingly, of course) get it wrong. The topic itself will show up in ChangeSummary and RecentChanges. There are good odds that one of the experts on the subject will read it and correct it.”13\nTechniques for Refactoring\nRefactoring accurately is important. One slip and the wrong sense of things might be reified; and while the wiki will eventually self-correct, the shift in direction is frustrating. Refactoring is also difficult. Writers don't always read a page through before adding to the thread, so comments are scattered and often redundant. Refactoring can take time and repeated sessions, and writers might continue to add threads to the page even as others are refactoring.14 The concern with staying close to ideas in refactoring is addressed by developing strategies and techniques for refactoring—strategies and techniques that the rest of this chapter will touch on. That is, to “be not cavalier” entails drawing on explicit, self-conscious, shared techniques for refactoring. So, to guide refactoring, rhetoric offers techniques. Here are two:\n• use double lines\n• use page patterns\nDoubleLines\nThe DoubleLines are an ad hoc technique borrowed from c2.com and MeatballWiki for distinguishing document from thread.
