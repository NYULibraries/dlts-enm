The higher the reservation wage, the longer an employee will remain unemployed. In fact, many workers counted in unemployment statistics are voluntarily unemployed in the sense that they have implicitly or explicitly turned down job opportunities that do not pay what they feel they deserve.\nThree types of governmental policies raising the reservation wage in recent decades are worth mentioning: unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, and public-assistance payments. Following up on the pioneering research of Gene Chapin, Martin Feldstein estimated in the 1970s that unemployment insurance payments serve to raise the aggregate unemployment rate by the better part of one full percentage point.17\nLess publicized is the extraordinary growth in workers’ compensation payments particularly in recent years. In 1989, over 13.8 million Americans from sixteen to sixty-four were classified as having an employment disability, some 8.6 percent of that population.18 As table 13.3 demonstrates, disability payments have exploded in recent years. In an earlier era, many persons who were unable to engage in heavy labor would have taken jobs requiring less physical effort. The establishment and expansion of the worker’s compensation program has sharply raised the reservation wage ",
