The future hidden in his fist. Exchange for sage's water.[Get the “chemical” (concentrated hydrochloric acid) in the Lab Equipment Room. Use it on the statue of an old man's hand in the Chemistry Lab to get the Gold medallion. Place it in the “Golden Sun” slot of the Clock Tower in order to make the hands stop at 12:00. Actually, as it was closed if you went before, this opens the piano's door in the Music Room.]\n12:00 “A place with songs and sound.” A silver guidepost is untapped in lost tongues. Awakening at the ordained order.[Go to the Music Room. Read the poem written in blood (“A tale of birds without a voice”) to know how to play the dead notes in the right order. Get the Silver medallion. Place it in the “Silver Moon” slot of the Clock Tower in order to make the hands stop at 5:00.]\n5:00 “Darkness that brings the choking heat.” Flames render the silence, awakening the hungry beast. Open time's door to beckon prey.[Go to the Boiler Room in the basement. Switch it on. Go back to the Clock Tower. Enter it.]\nDepending on the level of difficulty chosen in SH2 and SH3, the game's riddles are simplified and hints are provided. Some puzzle's solutions, like codes to open boxes, are randomly generated in the two games. But as the above example leads you to understand, there are many gatherings in Silent Hill. This is not to mention the various items you need to find in order to combine them. Analogous to the collection of crests in Resident Evil, you have to find four Plates to cross a door in the nightmarish Alchemilla Hospital of SH1, and five different items in “Nowhere” to proceed to the final boss fight, whereas it is five Tarot Cards that allow you to unlock this last door in SH3. In SH2, you need to get three coins to earn a key in the Blue Creek Apartment, three Tablets in the Toluca Prison for a Horseshoe, and three Music Boxes for the important Stairway Key of the Lake View Hotel. In SH: Homecoming, five Plates have to be found and put in the pentagon's slots of the church's organ in order to open a secret chamber. To help you find them, the player character turns his head to look at interesting items during his search. But contrary to Resident Evil, the backtracking is quite\n",
