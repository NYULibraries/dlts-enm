Eliot responded, \"It was a great joy to me to have your kind words of sympathy, for our long silence has never broken the affection for you which began when we were little ones\" (287).\nAlthough Eliot was well during their wedding trip to the continent, the occasion was marred by Cross’s illness on June 16 in Venice, where he was reported to have jumped from the balcony of their hotel into the Grand Canal. Cross himself ascribed the cause to \"this continual bad air, and the complete and sudden deprivation of all bodily exercise,\" although Haight concludes that his illness (from which he soon recovered) was \"an acute mental depression\" (Biography 544). Following their return to England in early August, Eliot wrote Charles by the end of the month that \"Johnnie gets a little better every day, and so each day is more enjoyable. But I am decidedly less well than I was when abroad. There is something languorous in this climate or rather in its effects\" (Letters 7:318). She became ill in September. Her health deteriorated quickly, and she died on December 22, \"from failure of the powers of the heart supervening on a bad cold,\" as Cross wrote that night (350).\nOn the wedding trip Eliot had written her good friend Barbara Bodichon of her marriage as \"a wonderful blessing falling to me beyond my share after I had thought that my life was ended. . . .

Although judging from the tone of this and other letters, she was delighted with the love and companionship afforded by her new marriage, her life in England after the wedding trip was taken up with social visits and moving–activities which she had never enjoyed. There is no sign of any further plans for writing. The timing of her death, shortly after her sixty-first birthday, and shortly after the second anniversary of Lewes’s death, suggests the extent of her identification with Lewes, who was also sixty-one when he died. Her sense of completion after the writing of Daniel Deronda, and her prophetic remark about her burial, \"Perhaps that will happen before next November,\" also suggest her readiness for death. Her fiction writing career had coincided with her life of \"dual solitude\" with Lewes.\nIn the preceding chapters I have focused on some of the ways in which aggression is portrayed in George Eliot’s novels.
