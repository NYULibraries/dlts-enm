My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath—a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff—he’s always, always in my mind—not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself—but as my own being” (ch. 9). Although he is less articulate about it, it is clear that Heathcliff’s sense of being is equally bound up with Cathy. He does not wish to survive her: “oh God! would you like to live with your soul in the grave?” (ch. 15). When they are merged with each other, they feel at home in the world, but when they are separated, they feel completely isolated in a universe that has turned into “a mighty stranger” (ch. 9).\nWuthering Heights is above all a novel about merger and separation. Cathy and Heathcliff are embattled children who become ontologically dependent on one another and who find in their alliance a mutual support that saves them from feeling alone in the world and gives meaning to their lives. They become embedded in this relationship and are unable to grow beyond it or to feel themselves whole beings with separate identities. The novel explores what happens when people who are so bound to each other are torn apart. After their union is shattered, they spend the rest of their lives looking back upon it as a paradisal state from which they have fallen and looking forward to a reattainment of their bliss, if not here, then hereafter. The most radical separation occurs when Catherine dies. There is an eventual movement back toward merger, which occurs at the end when Heathcliff joins her in the grave.\nThe first turning point in the relationship occurs when Hindley deprives Heathcliff of the instruction of the curate, drives him into the company of the servants, and makes him a common laborer. Heathcliff bears his “degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy [teaches] him what she learn[s], and work[s] or play[s] with him in the fields” (ch. 6); but the social difference Hindley has created becomes important after Cathy’s stay at the Linton’s and her sister-in-law’s efforts to make her into a lady. Before both had been “rude as savages”; now Cathy looks at Heathcliff from a distance and gives him the message that something is wrong with him. Cathy had been his sustaining source of affirmation, the withdrawal of which exposes him to painful feelings of inadequacy and self-hate. He becomes envious of Edgar Linton and feels that in ",
