He is furious because his father is out drinking when he should have been working on the job of making a coffin for a man in a neighboring village. While Adam stays up to finish the job himself, he thinks of his father’s continuously \"worsening\" behavior (92), but feels determined not to run away from the situation again, although he feels his father will be a \"sore cross\" to him for years to come. At that moment he hears a rap \"as if with a willow wand\" on the house door, goes to the door to look out, sees that no one seems to be there, and thinks of the superstition that the sound of a willow wand rapping on the door means that someone is dying (93). After he hears the sound again and still sees no sign of his father, he reasons that Thias is probably \"sleeping off his drunkenness at the [tavern].\" Not wanting to succumb to superstitious thinking, he determines not to open the door again, and for the rest of the night hears no more knocking. The next morning, however, Seth discovers that Thias has drowned during the night, \"not far from his own door,\" as Mr. Irwine says later (137).\nCarol Christ notes that Thias’s death \"occurs as a magical fulfillment of Adam’s anger\" (131); Krieger suggests that \"the resentfulness Adam feels . . . brings him close to wishing his father dead\" (211). It is possible to interpret Adam’s hearing the sound of the willow wand not only as a manifestation of his sense of foreboding, but as his wish for his father’s death. It is also possible to interpret Adam’s decision not to open the door again despite his father’s expected arrival as a form of passive aggression, and as an indirect contribution to his father’s death. In any case, Thias’s death causes Adam to repent his \"severity\" toward him (97). And this repentance, in Eliot’s view, turns out to be the first step of the process \"in which Adam learns to overcome his angry severity toward others\" (Christ 131).\nAdam’s attitude toward Arthur and Hetty repeats the pattern of his attitude toward his parents. Even before he realizes they are actually having an affair, he is openly outraged at Arthur’s involvement with Hetty and provokes him into a fight. Yet he has trouble seeing any wrong in Hetty even after it becomes clear that she has abandoned her baby. Adam’s reluctance to feel hostile toward Hetty is related to his reluctance to be angry with his mother. His dream, which recounts the ",
