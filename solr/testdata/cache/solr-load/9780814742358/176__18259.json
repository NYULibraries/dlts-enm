            "pageText": "something beyond this need to rescue in his attraction to Gwendolen–\"something due to the fascination of her womanhood.\" His imagination, at this point in the story, is \"much occupied with two women, to neither of whom would he have held it possible that he should ever make love. Hans Meyrick had laughed at him for having something of the knight-errant in his disposition\" (370). On the one hand, Deronda is a sensitive person who likes to help people. Yet on the other, he is something of a lady-killer. Like Gwendolen, he possesses that narcissistic quality of attracting and rejecting (in the sense of not seriously intending a relationship that can be permanent) the opposite sex. In his last scene with Gwendolen, when he finally \"rejects\" her by telling her he plans to marry Mirah, he recognizes his \"cruelty\" to her: \"Deronda’s anguish was intolerable. … ’I am cruel too, I am cruel,' he repeated\" (877).\nDeronda is also like Gwendolen in his sense of rootlessness. He does not know anything about his background, but as the novel progresses, he slowly discovers and accepts his Jewish heritage. The need to feel connected to a heritage and to a land is an extension of his original need for his mother. Deronda responds to the Jewish liturgy in the way that a child responds to its union with its mother: \"the forms of the Judengasse, rous[ed] the sense of union with what is remote\" (414). As Feni-chel explains, \"Certain narcissistic feelings of well-being [for example, religious or patriotic feelings] are characterized by the fact that they are felt as a reunion with an omnipotent force in the external world. . . . The longing [for such a connection] can be called the 'narcissistic need'\" (40).\nWhen Deronda finally finds his mother, he must confront her rejection of him. She says, \"I did not wish you to be born. I parted with you willingly\" (697). She explains that she rejected both the role of motherhood and her Jewish heritage because of her father’s oppression of her. She is like Gwendolen in this: because she feels oppressed by a male-dominated culture, she has no interest in the customary female role. \"I am not a loving woman,\" she says. She has also, like Gwendolen, been a femme fatale. \"Men have been subject to me,\" she says (730). She is only able to be in male-female relationships in which one person has power over the other. The passage in which Deronda meets his mother occurs just before the scene in which Gwendolen, on the boat with Grandcourt, recognizes the full strength of his control over her, along with her own dread of becoming a mother. The two situations are parallel: a father’s oppression is a factor in the \"failure\" of a daughter’s \"maternal instinct.\"\n",
