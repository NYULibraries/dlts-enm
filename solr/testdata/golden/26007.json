            "pageText": "is an implicit protest against patriarchy, that the lesbian lifestyle embodies the feminist ideal of independence from men and provides self-knowledge and self-esteem, and that all feminists should at least be political lesbians if not sexual lesbians all characterize the behavioral bisexual as a feminist failure. The argument that lesbians have greater insight and resources to offer the feminist movement leads to the conclusion that bisexuals are, in fact, even more of a political liability than heterosexual women are because bisexuals do not merely give their energy to men instead of women; they take women’s energy and give it to men. This is compounded by the fact that women who continue to relate to men forego the opportunity to demonstrate that lesbianism is a choice and thereby collude with heterosexist interpretations of lesbianism.\nBisexual behavior is also problematic for the notion of lesbian ethnicity because, just as bisexual attraction threatens the clarity of the defining characteristic of lesbian ethnicity, bisexual behavior provides visible evidence that the boundaries between lesbians (the oppressed group) and heterosexuals (the oppressor) are neither clear nor fixed. Allies cannot be clearly distinguished from enemies and allies sometimes become enemies and vice versa. Under such circumstances, the struggle for liberation is very difficult.\nIn contrast, a few of lesbians’ arguments have positive implications for bisexuality defined in terms of behavior. The feminists who argue for every woman’s right to a self-defined sexuality, the sex positivists, and those who argue that sexual relations with women are no more important than nonsexual ones or that heterosexual relations do not preclude feminism, have no difficulty accepting the woman who behaves bisexually as a feminist on a par with the lesbian.\nPerhaps the most interesting implication for behavioral bisexuality follows from the argument that lesbianism should be defined in terms of relationships with women instead of in terms of the absence of relationships with men. Although this argument succeeds in defining lesbianism in positive terms, it simultaneously defines bisexuality out of existence by classifying any woman who engages in lesbian behavior as a lesbian, regardless of whether or not she also engages in heterosexual behavior. It is ironic that creating a positive definition of lesbianism necessarily defines bisexuality in the most negative terms possible—as nonexistent.\nOther interesting implications follow from the argument that the ",
