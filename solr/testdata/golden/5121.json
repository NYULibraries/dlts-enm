The mania for standardized testing, so evident in the United States at this writing, has had many results—some salutary, some not—but in the history classroom, what it has meant is that students have become very adept at answering questions about the past, but not so adept at asking the kinds of questions we think are important. Where our students want certainty about the past, and to find the correct answer, due to the nature of our training, historians come to the classroom filled with a sense of historical contingency, a belief that the past is almost always equivocal, and that the first order of business for us is to formulate good questions about that past that will lead us in productive directions. The result of the inevitable clash between our students' desire for certainty and our devotion to uncertainty is that many, if not most, students spend the semester trying to create certainties out of the uncertainties presented by their professor, while the professor often becomes increasingly frustrated by his or her students' inability or simply unwillingness to dig into the uncertainties.37 Most students do not want to spend much time on Weinberg's jagged edges of the past, fearing that they might be injured there. And who can blame them?\nIt is common among history teachers to complain that too often our students produce versions of the past that are heavy on cliché and caricature. To describe the work product of our students in this way is to do most of them a disservice. The jagged edge of history is an uncomfortable and unsettling place, and because so much of our teaching is predicated upon lecturing at them, it is no wonder they rely so heavily on tropes that they know and the regurgitation of facts we emphasize from the front of the room. For instance, it is a comforting certainty for American students that in the Second World War, Americans were the good guys, and the Germans and Japanese were the bad guys. This notion is reinforced by many years of schooling, television, and other forms of popular media. But if we take our students out onto the jagged edges of the past, they may learn unsettling realities, such as the fact that during “the Good War” U.S. commanders fought long and hard to suppress the practice of mutilating Japanese war dead by American servicemen.38 Familiar stories about the war reinforce the notion that our servicemen fought in honorable ways. The strange reality of the past is that some of those same men mutilated enemy war dead in ways that the popular imagination almost always attributes to the bad guys on the other side.
