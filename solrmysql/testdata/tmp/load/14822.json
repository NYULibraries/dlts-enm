While reading the material, I kept wondering how it must have felt to have seen a published ad about his own death on April 26, 1948, and then, a day later, the announcement that he was alive but badly wounded. What did it feel like to reread the debates, letters of protest he wrote engulfed by surging emotions, when some of those referred to are already dead? What is his reaction when he reads dramatic claims for socialism and the belief that Stalin was the sun of the nation when he does not believe in it any longer? Over the years, Dov has collected hundreds of newspaper clips, primarily documenting his activities, letters to the editors, and public speeches in Hebrew, English, and Arabic, as if awaiting his biography to be written one day.\nReviewing the titles that other writers had ascribed to him, it became very clear that this man was perceived as a unique and rare individual who has become increasingly scarce in our society. Truly altruistic people are a rare species (Staub 1978; Rushton 1980; Oliner and Oliner 1988) in any society, and due to Israel’s relatively small size, Dov had attracted a great deal of attention. The titles of the many articles written by different journalists at various times consistently reflect the two facets of the man, the activist military man and the dreamer-passionate, empathic human being. For example, Tom Segev of Ha’aretz entitled his article The Good Soul from Nahariya. Paraphrasing Brecht’s play The Good Soul [Woman] of Szechwan, Segev wrote, “Dov Yirmiya is breaking the last taboo; he might be sentenced for advocating sarvanut. Yirmiya, a farmer, a soldier and a musician, the man with a thousand battles could be exceptional story material.” As for his personality, Segev continued, “He hates the slogan ‘shooting and crying,’ he shoots and thinks; old-young, charming and generous, he always fights for his principles and always pays for it.” He concluded the article with, “I tried to convince him to write the story of his life, but Yirmiya said that there are more important things he had to do” (Ha’aretz, March 3, 1988).\nDov refers to his first “shoot and think” incident during the War of Independence (1948), when he was confronted with a moral dilemma of whether or not to overlook a war crime that one of his officers, a close friend, had committed. This young man killed thirty-five Arab civilians who had previously surrendered. After painful deliberations, Dov decided to report the incident, thereby initiating the only military court-martial for such a crime during ",
