The proliferation of links is evident in a road map that links to the Web sites of the various commercial establishments shown on the map, for instance, or in a traveler's map that links to reviews of and articles on various tourist sites.\n25. For an interesting take on maps of the Internet, see http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol5/issue4/dodge_kitchin.htm.\n26. This “invention of reality” is not always a positive development. The power of naming—the ability of maps to will a nonexistent entity into reality simply by naming—was evident recently when Google Earth, relying on a short-lived name from the period of World War II, mistakenly labeled a mountain in Bavaria as “Mount Hitler.” This mistake, which virtually invented a reality for the mountain, was strongly protested by local residents.\n27.
