He first came to know his own total depravity and unworthiness, and he then rose up because of Jesus: “[E]very promise I thought upon held forth Christ unto me, saying, ‘I am thy salvation.”‘13 Such a conversion experience was not a sudden or immediate event; it usually required hearing sermons and conferring with ministers during “a long period of intensive and prolonged introspection.”14 A properly related or explained conversion experience signified to the church’s minister and congregants that the individual had been touched by God’s grace—that the person was a “visible saint”—and therefore could become a member of the church.15 Ministers such as the early Cambridge pastor Thomas Shepard devoted many sermons to conversion, exhorting “believers to pursue diligently the divinely appointed ‘means’ for salvation and assurance and, for further proof, introspectively search for the ‘signs’ or ‘evidences’ that God had performed a work of grace in their lives.”16 Once an individual became a church member (usually through a vote of the congregation), he or she enjoyed significant benefits. While all residents had to attend church and pay taxes to support it, only true church members could receive the all-important Lord’s Supper. More significant (politically), only male church members could attain full civil citizenship, including suffrage.17\nHence, whereas English Puritanism pulsed with an undercurrent of populism, New England Puritanism seemed to justify elitism (which, of course, fit the dominant social position of the New Englanders). The Massachusetts Bay Puritans reconciled their emphasis on the conversion experience with the standard Calvinist concept of predestination to legitimate the civil and religious rule of the few. Kai Erikson notes:\n\nThe truth as seen by the Puritans was wholly clear. God had chosen an elite to represent Him on earth and to join Him in Heaven. People who belonged to this elite learned of their appointment through the agency of a deep conversion experience, giving them a special responsibility and a special competence to control the destinies of others.18\n\nWhile, on the one hand, the New England Puritans conceived of the state as closely related to the church, on the other hand, they simultaneously understood the church and the state to be distinct institutions. As John Cotton explained, “God’s institutions (such as the government of church and of commonwealth) may be close and compact, and co-ordinate one to another, and yet not confounded.”19 Hence, for example, the Puritans decided that the offices of the church and the civil government should be differentiated and that excommunication should not prompt ",
