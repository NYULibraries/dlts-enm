An acknowledgment that judicial power is political power forces the debate onto the preferable terrain of “fairness”—a battleground that terrifies the Journal.\nMoreover, acknowledging that judicial power is political power does not mean abandoning the Court to majoritarianism. As has been well said, “Constitutional review is intended to be antimajoritarian,” and so “to argue against it based on majoritarian principles is pointless.”66 To the extent that judicial review, in practice, is overwhelmed by majoritarian principles,67 judicial review can be said to be malfunctioning.\nFinally, one defense of Guinier offered by some, notably Attorney General Janet Reno, was that the Journal’s fears were misplaced because Guinier would not be free to enforce her admittedly radical ideas. She would be a member of the Clinton administration, and so bound by its policies. If one bought this argument, one might go on to point out an even more impressive constraint on both Guinier and the Clinton administration: the rule of law. For neither Guinier nor the Clinton administration would ever have had the last word on anything. They would all be mere parties before a court. So, why worry? Indeed, if Clint Bolick was right that Guinier was, objectively, an exotic civil rights ideologue, why was he hyperventilating? Surely the supposed objective rule of law would rebuff her zealotry? In fact, the Journal was canny enough to know that the law means nothing more nor less than the extent to which it is enforced. Bolick feared adverse political results for causes dear to him should Guinier get her hands on what he called “the civil rights arsenal.” Now dawns the reason why the Journal, in what was ostensibly its opening salvo against Guinier as an individual appointee and litigator, actually spent most of its energy on the NAACP “wagon trains” seeking fairness among judges. What the Journal wanted to avoid was a two-pronged danger. The first: an aggressive, articulate, experienced litigator (Guinier) taking civil rights cases before the courts. The second: fair courts that might listen to strong argument. The Journal alluded to supposed evils wreaked by some of the state laws requiring that judges reflect the diversity of the communities over which they preside. These laws had, said the Journal, “provided an open door for yahoos and stooges of the trial lawyers.” Fair judges are the feared “yahoos” and Guinier’s civil rights division, the feared trial lawyers.\nThe Journal placed the word “fair” in skeptical question marks, presumably indicating that its opponents’ claims for the fairness of the new judge-selection procedures were not objective, and implying that its own call for ",
