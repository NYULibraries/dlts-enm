            "pageText": "it, I see that I have accumulated information and improved my social skills considerably. I acquired a good knowledge of English, which I couldn’t have done otherwise. My level of English was higher than Yardi’s, who had studied in the university all those years! I also made progress in my studies toward a degree in engineering, which I had planned to obtain. The experience of living daily with nine men, the organization of our time and space, became a significant lesson for life. Just recently I heard about three couples who had returned from a week-long yacht cruise, and they told me how awful it was to be stuck with each other for so long. …\nEach one of us absorbed a lot from the others, and we all matured as a result. It was illuminating to be exposed to a wide variety of opinions on every subject and to listen to the life stories of each of the men. Although we were careful not to expose our intimate life, many barriers came down in time.\nIn spite of this, I see my four years in captivity as wasted, unnecessary, and unheroic. I would have been able to learn the same lesson elsewhere or to live without it. I feel no nostalgia about the group or the period, and I rarely give it a thought. I never leaf through my letters or our diary. I don’t feel driven to share my experience and its conclusions, as some of my friends do.\nOn the other hand, I’m upset by the fact that the army didn’t make use of our experience. They debriefed us, for sure, but I don’t know whether they put any of the information to use. I was under the impression that nobody wanted to draw the proper conclusions from my experience, despite the fact that it was up-to-date and quite important.\nI have never recovered from the unprofessional reception we were given in Israel, even though a lot of studies exist in the world on this subject. They thought that once they had thrown us into deep water, we’d have to swim. This was a mistake, however.\nIt may sound absurd, but our long captivity cured us of the shock of being captured. We had time to process the event and we returned home more grounded and balanced. This is mainly because we had enough time to recover from the trauma of the failure of falling into enemy hands. By building ourselves up during the long captivity, our sense of failure was abated somehow. ",
