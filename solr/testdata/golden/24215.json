The assignment calling for them to analyze the representation of blacks in a current news story, at the very least, enabled many of them to comprehend something about representational politics.\nDuring the second half of the semester, my students focused on one longer project of their own design: they could write a traditional literary analysis if they thought doing so would best get them to engage in the aesthetic and political issues we had discussed, but they were also allowed to propose a creative project that responded in some way to the issues of our course. If they chose to do a creative project, students were asked to turn in a three- to four-page statement explaining what their project was, why they chose to do this particular project, and how it related to the works we had read during the semester. Two-thirds of the students in the Morrison class chose to work on creative projects, and most told me at the end of the semester that it was the most meaningful, exciting assignment they had worked on in their undergraduate careers.\nLike Paulo Freire, I wanted to motivate students to begin to relinquish their belief and dependence on the banking system of education, where the professor is the authority who deposits knowledge into students. Instead, I hoped that I could act less as an authority and more as what Kenneth Mostern calls “a critical pedagogue”:\n\nsomeone who teaches from where the student is at, rather than from where the teacher is at. This does not mean that the teacher denies his or her pedagogical intentions or specific expertise, but merely that s/he respects the myriad expertise of the students that s/he does not share. Second, the critical pedagogue works for social justice, and, living in a world of injustice, not only attempts to enact change in his or her classroom, but develops the strategies and confidence of students to work for social change beyond the classroom.30\n\nThe projects my students chose embraced a wide range of approaches, and outlining a few of them will, I hope, illustrate the ",
