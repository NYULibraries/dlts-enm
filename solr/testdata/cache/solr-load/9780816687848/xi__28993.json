By the 1980s, Filipino youth had come to dominate the local DJ scene in places like San Francisco and the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York, subsequently making their mark nationally not only as battle DJs but also as club DJs, and radio DJs in an expressive form historically associated with African Americans. This phenomenon has international dimensions as well with Filipino DJs from Canada and Australia winning competitions and both success and acclaim.2 The crowd’s response, therefore, was not a surprise given the emergence of DJing as a signifier of Filipino youth identity and the now commonplace assumption that Filipinos make the best DJs in the world.\nIn highlighting the dominance of Filipino youth in DJ culture, the host that night spoke to how DJing has become a constituent element of Filipino youth identities and cultural practices. At the same time, however, he touched on a set of issues that will be addressed in this study, issues having to do with the contours of contemporary youth culture, politics, and identity and more broadly, the configurations of U.S. racial formations and global diasporic formations in the post–civil rights era.
