            "pageText": "intimidation; (D) under the particular circumstances of the case, the member’s continued presence in the armed forces is consistent with the interests of the armed forces in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and (E) the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts.\n(2) the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.\n(3) the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex.57\nAlthough this rule received publicity as an attempt to moderate the military’s treatment of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, it actually empowers the military to discharge homosexuals more easily. The first part of the rule allows individuals to be excluded based on conduct alone. As with previous rules, it permits exceptions where the conduct is allegedly inconsistent with an individual’s orientation. As such, it retains the exception for the individual who is willing to disavow his or her same-sex sexual feelings or actions.\nThe second part of the rule is broader than past rules, because it allows for the exclusion of individuals based on speech, irrespective of a finding of any sexual activity. Under the old rules, the military had to presume a connection between speech and action (as in the benShalom case). Under the new rules, no such presumption is required. The mere statement that one is homosexual or bisexual apparently conflicts with military morale and is a ground for discharge. In addition, the second part of the rule provides explicitly for the exclusion of bisexuals. One does not have to label bisexuals as “homosexuals” in order to exclude them.\n",
