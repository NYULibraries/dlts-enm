The workshops I attended all emphasized skills that the district believed refugee families and students lacked, including, for example, how to wash their hands, shampoo their hair, eat a “well-rounded” meal, and exercise.\n      For the Zion School District, refugee students were a significant concern because they were highly unlikely to earn proficient scores on the standardized NCLB measures of achievement. Because so much of the district’s reputation, funding, and autonomy rested on how well students performed on these tests, the central office had a substantial interest in “stepping in”—and thus side-stepping site-based leadership norms. Interests converged around the need to better serve refugee students, but the direction of the efforts was shaped by whiteness. There was a shared sense of sympathy and compassion among educators, which drove the deficit-oriented approach to the refugee services offered by the Zion School District. Sympathy and compassion are part of niceness, so here again, the focus on refugee services engages niceness in ways that are expected and accepted among educators.\n      Converging Interests and Cost Controls\n      How diversity-related policies were implemented and subsequent diversity-related efforts were enacted in the Zion School District seem to fall under two general frameworks. There are those policies that were mandated by the central office and those that were readily left up to the schools to implement. When it came to diversity-related efforts, those mandated by the central office were only and always the policies that had, in turn, been mandated or funded by the federal government. Everything else was left up to the schools, which meant that school leadership had a significant amount of discretion in determining when equity was pursued and when it was not. What this meant in the Zion School District was that those schools that primarily served students of color and that had not been meeting accountability standards were more likely to take up diversity efforts as a means to achieving this end. But schools that were secure in their aggregate performance on standardized assessments generally did not see diversity initiatives as useful or necessary. Interest convergence and the possessive investment in whiteness provide a way to understand this phenomenon because schools are acting in ways that protect their own interests; sometimes ",
