In the meantime it has been decided in forty towns and villages, that they will in the future not allow any destructive newspaper into their domains. They will muster all their strength to support exclusively only those newspapers which serve the national Christian line, and they will distribute only those. This decision should serve as an example for all Hungarian towns and villages.117\nThe Protestant churches held a mass rally in Budapest at the beginning of December 1919. The subject of the rally was “the spirit of Christian unity.” At this rally, too, the familiar voices of antisemitic incitement could be heard. Dr. Andras Csillery, a former government minister, declared that “we bear witness to the war of liberation of Christianity against Jewish Talmudism.”\nIstvan Haller, a government minister, claimed at that rally that\nthe decision of the Christian populace to insist on its right to succeed in life in opposition to the Jewish oppression from which it has suffered until today—is not antisemitism. Just as an oak tree has a natural right to grow, to spread and to be stronger than the thorny bushes and shrubs growing at its base, so we have the right to grow and become powerful on our own soil. The path which shall best serve our ambition to guarantee our territorial and political integrity is that which follows Christian policy. The fact that the various minorities have shown hostility toward us was merely the result of the Jewish policy we adhered to. Let us adopt Christian policies—and they will return to us.\nAnd so the conclusion reached at the Protestant church rally reads that “our terrible disaster was brought about by the destructive international policy which acted against our Christian and national spirit.”\nThough one of the speakers at the rally, Gyorgy Szekely, the chairman of the Protestant committee in the National Union party, announced that “tolerance and magnanimity toward those of other faiths and those of other nationalities are based on the fundamental outlook of the Protestant church in Hungary,” his words clearly omitted the attitude of participants in the rally toward Jews.\nEvangelical Bishop Sandor Raffay and the Reformed Bishop Elek Petri, the spiritual leaders of the two Protestant churches in Hungary, also spoke at the rally. Their speeches were not cited at length in the newspaper report, but the latter does note that the two bishops announced “their churches’ enthusiastic support” of the ideas expressed at the rally.118\nThis Christian-national-social organization was not limited to the halls in which its rallies were held. The organizers appealed in various ways to the public at large, making use, among other tactics, of placards in ",
