            "pageText": "Morgan le Fay—all are introduced at one or another mess. Lady Bertilak smothers Gawain with affection at the table to test his courtesy, and Gawain proves himself by responding with good nurture, despite the obvious dangers.165 His responses to such clandestine communications at mealtime tell whether he deserves his status as a Knight of the Round Table. His character is established there. It is easy to overlook the fact that the table is a central character in the chivalric romance too. The poetry is composed out of the sundry worldly properties that it finds indispensable and fit for purpose, and without which there would not be the same idea of human refinement or befitting behavior.166\n        Wynnere and Wastoure offers a lengthy ekphrasis on the feast of the spendthrift that expresses the matter equally well, if putting into even sharper focus the peculiar poetic quality and dramatic choreography of the table. As in Sir Gawain, here the portrayal of delicacies is turned into sumptuous verse, calling up an extended list of menu items, including a boar’s head, vegetables, venison, mixed grains, pheasant, and meat pies, and if that is not sufficient, “anothir [dish] comes aftir, / Roste with the riche sewes [gravy] and the ryalle spyces.”167 But that is to refer to not quite a quarter of the lines devoted to the rich man’s banquet, a delectable feast that is matched by lyrical and lexicographical extravagance. The listing is a significant poetic device here, as in Sir Gawain, the verse having assembled and assumed the form of the sequential matter that is served at the feast—tabulating the table much as do the wordbooks of Adam Petit Pont and Alexander Nequam. The itemization of things is an index of the impression they make on the text as one body among others; and ultimately, the index constitutes a textual corpus. There are other intertextual conditions one can consider as sources of these literary compositions, and those are the ones everyone cites. In Wynnere and Wastoure, the spendthrift denies the poor outside his gates, a biblical motif (based on Luke 16, Lazarus and the rich man) that gets reiterated elsewhere in both Langland and Chaucer.168 And one could compare a large body of literature devoted to criticizing gluttony and gourmandizing. But the relevant intertexts do not circulate independently in some remote literary sphere above mundane chains of reference, for even the most diagrammatic and exemplary text must affiliate with substantive things. In Cleanness, a homiletic poem by the same author who composed the better-known Sir Gawain, there is a retelling of the ",
