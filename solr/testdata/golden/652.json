            "pageText": "\nthey would otherwise be left without possibilities to expand (Levy 1999; Galperin 2004; McQuail and Siune 1998; Brown and Picard 2004). There was considerable doubt among politicians as to whether this was a future-oriented choice, but they were convinced by public service broadcasters arguing that the institutions would otherwise be marginalized and turned into “analogue museums” (Syvertsen 2008, 225). In the Nordic countries, but also elsewhere such as in the United Kingdom, the role assigned to the former monopolists’ post-digitalization was rather that of “digital locomotives”; they were entrusted with the obligation to spearhead the transition to information societies and act as a bulwark against the threat of global media giants (Syvertsen 2008, 220; Aslama and Syvertsen 2007). This meant looser regulatory frameworks than, for example, their German sister organizations had to deal with (Moe 2009), further setting them apart from the state-owned broadcasters in southern European countries such as Spain, Italy, and Portugal (e.g., Brevini 2010).\nFrom the late 1990s, public service institutions in the region played a key role in the building of a digital infrastructure in their respective countries. From 2007 in Sweden and Finland and 2009 in Norway and Denmark, the public service broadcasters made the switch over to digital television networks (e.g., Storsul and Sundet 2006; Brown and Picard 2004). Digitalization has made it possible for public service broadcasters to set up new channels, and their assigned role as digital locomotives has allowed them to enter new platforms, including the Internet and mobile telephony (Moe 2009). These moves have all been crucial for rebuilding a central position in the digital age. Indeed, as Søndergaard (2008, 43) argues, as a result of digitalization the public service broadcasters “have been strengthened to such an extent that hardly otherwise would have been possible.” Furthermore, this shows how public service broadcasters have to a large degree retained their historical role in securing universal access to information and media content also in the digital era.\nAn Equal and Secure Source of Income\nA further indication of the central role that the public service broadcasters continue to play in Nordic societies is the fact that they retain an equal and secure funding source. Up until recently, this funding across the region has been in the form of a traditional broadcasting license fee. In Iceland, the license fee was abolished in 2007 and the RÚV also takes advertising. In 2013, Finland introduced a specific YLE tax to be paid by everyone 18 or older, regardless of set ownership and media use (Ala-Fossi 2012). The remaining Nordic public service broadcasters, NRK, DR, and the three Swedish ones, all belong to a rare breed that have retained the license fee as the dominant form of revenue. In one case, the license fee has been extended, as in 2007 Denmark changed it to a media fee that covered all terminals capable of receiving audio-visual content—including personal computers and smartphones. More importantly, the four larger Nordic countries, Finland included, keep the broadcasting corporations comparatively well funded and free from regular radio and television advertising.\n",
