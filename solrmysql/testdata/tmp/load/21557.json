For example, prior to the development of the modern welfare state, there were no meaningful racial differentials in unemployment. However, throughout the post-World War II era, unemployment among nonwhites has systematically exceeded that among whites, currently by a ratio of more than two to one.\nParticularly striking has been the deterioration in the relative unemployment position of young black males. In 1954, the first year in which annual unemployment data are available by race and age group, the unemployment rate for white males aged sixteen through nineteen was 13.4 percent. The similar rate for nonwhites was 14.4 percent. Eighteen years later, in 1972, the unemployment rate for white males aged sixteen through nineteen stood at 14.2 percent, 0.8 of one percentage point higher than it was in 1954. This was the first year in which data were available for blacks as a separate group, rather than just for nonwhites. The rate for black males aged sixteen through nineteen was 31.7 percent, more than twice the 1954 rate for nonwhites. Similarly, the female-male unemployment differential grew in the immediate postwar era, albeit to a much lesser extent.\nNot only has the state aggravated the problem of unemployment for Americans, it has done so differentially. The biggest losers from state intervention have been the very people that advocates of activism have claimed need the most help, namely nonwhites, women, and unskilled and inexperienced youths. The strong, skilled, and comparatively affluent have managed to adjust to state intervention, although not without cost. The burden of the welfare state has fallen inordinately on those it was supposed to benefit the most.\nThe Contemporary Scene\nSo much for the past. It might legitimately be asked how our analysis and findings relate both to contemporary economic thinking and to the current and future economic scene. As to the first of these, we note Martin Bronfenbrenner’s comment in the foreword that some readers might regard our efforts as “distillations from quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore.” That some might respond in this fashion would not surprise us, given that we place so much emphasis on the role of equilibrium wage rates in the business cycle. However, we think that such a view is misplaced. Rather, we prefer to view what we have done as quite mainstream with respect to the current discussions of macroeconomic matters.
