            "pageText": "usage, and they also seem to suit Socrates quite well. That we apply to Socrates descriptions of integrity that probably were derived in part from his words and acts in the first place is a harmless circularity. He has helped mold later ideas of integrity. And if returning to his words and deeds may revivify a sense of his integrity and his right, even, to help define integrity, the fact remains that integrity as Socrates practiced it shows some strange features. My purpose in this chapter is to explore some of these features. For the most part, I concentrate on Socrates as Plato presented him in the Apology of Socrates, with some attention to the Crito. Whether or not the Socrates of the Apology, especially, was the real Socrates in every main feature cannot be established. Let it suffice to say that if it were not for the Apology but also the Crito, Socrates would not have been as influential in helping define integrity as he has proved to be. The hold of Socrates on the imagination altogether, but certainly on the understanding of the meaning of integrity, would be much less without these two works.\nThe strangeness of Socrates is owing to his negativity. It is no revelation to say that Socrates wrote nothing and maintained that he knew nothing. These are among his most famous manifestations of negativity. But his negativity is comprehensive and calls for an accounting that makes it constitutive of his integrity. That is, he may be a model of integrity because he is so extensively negative.\nI use the word negativity to include more than the two manifestations just mentioned. Socrates practices negativity also in the sense that he says no to the doctrines of others without producing one of his own; his inner voice never says yes, but only no; he works on the hypothesis that the content of his wisdom is nothing, is ignorance; he knows what injustice is, not what virtuous excellence is; he knows how to act by abstention, avoidance, self-denial, and noncompliance; and he is prepared to contemplate eternal nothingness after death. There are other manifestations of negativity as well. Socratesâ€™ unforgettable presence is thus put together from elements that seem to lack any fullness, any positive definition. His integrity is nevertheless perfectly full; as a personage, he is most positively defined. But his fullness and definition arise ",
