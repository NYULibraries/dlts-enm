            "pageText": "\nSeveral male and a couple female students were definitely interested in getting guns for their avatars and learning how to fire them. Ms. Canon said that she thought some avatars had come to TEC Island and left a stash of guns. When Doe Magic got a gun, he jokingly asked her, “Can I get arrested in Second Life?” “You can get in trouble for hacking, but that's about all,” she answered. “Can you shoot people?” he continued. “Yes!” Jada answered. “How do you shoot a gun?” he continued “Do you know how to shoot a gun?” Jada knew how to put guns into her inventory that she could then attach to her avatar and carry around, but she did not know how to shoot them. We didn't teach them how to shoot guns, but we understood their fascination with this feature of the virtual environment from their play with video games. We also realized that even though it has a more open-ended script, Second Life was also a game, and residents often called themselves players. This unit in the World Media classes was influenced, in part, by scholars like Gee (2004) and Shaffer (2006) who have conceptualized ways that video games and computer games facilitated types of learning and literacy development.\nAlthough our intent was not to look at traditional video games like those the students might already be playing, there were a couple of times during the unit when the video game possibilities of Teen Second Life inadvertently erupted in the class. For example, at one point during the part of the unit in which we were encouraging students to travel and explore, Terrance, whose avatar was GReala Blitz, yelled out excitedly to the class, “Hey look. They fightin' man. Look. They fightin'.” Jada and a couple other students went over to his computer station. “Hey,” he said, “you want me to tell you what they said?” He laughed loudly. Jada said, “I want to go where you are. You better get up out of there before they shoot you. I think he's really shooting at you.” The sound of gunfire could be heard. A student calls out from the other side of the lab, “Y'all playin' Grand Theft Auto?” From where I was standing, I could see several avatars hiding behind or inside of different structures at the site and firing rifles at each other. Eventually, one of them started shooting in the direction of Terrance's avatar. Terrance made GReala Blitz run in the opposite direction, and the other avatar gave chase while still shooting. GReala Blitz ran around a corner and down a narrow street, then hid inside of one of the buildings. The students who had gathered around Terrance's computer where shouting out suggestions for what he should do next. The hostile avatar walked around the corner, paused for a moment, and peered down the long street. Then it turned around and ",
