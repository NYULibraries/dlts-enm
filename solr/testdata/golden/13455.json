INTRODUCTORY\nWhat does compensatory justice seek to accomplish?* A formal answer, of course, is that, like all justice, it seeks to assure each his due. Aristotle’s analysis of “corrective” or “rectificatory” justice, however, proffers a more specific answer:\n\nWhat the judge aims at doing is to make the parts equal by the penalty he imposes, whereby he takes from the aggressor any gain he may have secured. The equal, then is a mean between the more and the less. But gain and loss are each of them more or less in opposite ways, more good and less evil being gains, the more evil and the less good being loss. The equal, which we hold to be just, is now seen to be intermediate between them. Hence we conclude that corrective justice must be the mean between loss and gain. This explains why the disputants have recourse to a judge; for to go to a judge is to go to justice. . . . What the judge does is to restore equality.1\n\n",
