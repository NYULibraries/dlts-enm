            "pageText": "assumes she will marry Harold; on her second visit, she asks to go with Rufus to visit Felix; at this point, she feels \"divided and oppressed\" by the need to make a decision (550)–but the jail visit ends with their declaration of love, in the form of a kiss and an embrace.\nAfter the courtroom scene, Esther is back at Transome Court. She has become increasingly aware of the \"joyless, embittered age\" that has replaced the \"youthful brilliancy\" of Mrs. Transome’s past, as evident in her portrait as a young woman (585). Harold, meanwhile, has learned the truth about his parentage, and, seeing his life in a new light, offers to \"proceed at once to the necessary legal measures for putting [Esther] in possession of [her] own\" (588). By this time, however, Esther had undergone \"something little short of an inward revolution.\" At Transome Court, she had come to see herself \"in a silken bondage that arrested all motive, and was nothing better than a well-cushioned despair\" (592). Thus finally able to make her decision to resign \"all claim to the Transome estates,\" she returns to her father’s house (599).\nEsther’s \"inward revolution\" is more convincing than Romola’s because her growth is presented as a \"slow growing system of things,\" made visible to the reader. Esther’s growth begins with Felix’s insistence on her change; but first it is necessary for her to get a clear picture of her parents, including her adoptive father, Rufus. Esther had had no clear memory of her mother; she had only \"a broken vision of the time before she was five years old\" (161). After Rufus tells her the details of her past, she is then able, on the basis of her new knowledge, to begin to appreciate her life with Rufus, as she lets go of her fantasies of \"rank and fortune.\" In Kernberg’s terms, she can finally distinguish her realistic self and parent images from her idealized ones. At Transome Court, she confronts \"the dimly-suggested tragedy of [Mrs. Transome's] life, the dreary waste of years\" and she is \"afflicted . . . even to horror.\" The reality of Mrs. Transome’s life is the \"last vision to urge her towards the life where the draughts of joy sprang from the unchanging fountains of reverence and devout love\" (597); thus she completes the process of her \"conversion.\" Esther is able to use the vision of the \"bad\" (lost) mother, in the present form of Mrs. Transome, as part of the process of leaving her deceased parents behind (or, of renouncing her inheritance) and making her decision to marry Felix. Esther’s decision to leave behind the lost mother is analogous to Eppie’s movement away from the deceased ",
