            "pageText": "The scripts deny Marilyn any recognition of homophobia as a factor in her relationship with Allison. Marilyn reviews her life in personal terms with no attention to social/political realities. She asks, “What were my options? Stay in a marriage that was false? To live a lie? To sneak around and deceive your father? Because once he knew, he wanted no part of me.” Viewed in this way, Marilyn’s choices are determined by the relationship in which she happens to find herself; no recourse through political action is considered. The absence of a politicized view of the personal in Heartbeat again masks homophobia and reinforces hetero/sexism. When Allison expresses concern that she may one day “find out like I’m like you,” Marilyn assures Allison that her heterosexuality is evidenced in her obvious love for her future husband. Marilyn does not question (or even suggest) the compulsory nature of heterosexuality; she reasserts the authenticity of love rather than situating it as a socially constructed and controlled experience. Female sexuality is muted later when Allison asks Marilyn, “How did you know [that you were lesbian]?” and Marilyn responds, “It was in my heart. That is the truth, Allison. It wasn’t … [pause] … just physical.” It is important that lesbianism not be defined solely in terms of physical sexual practices. However, because Marilyn is never shown in a sexual situation, the words further remove her from desire.\nThe show’s tacit endorsement of public restrictions on physical/sexual contact between lesbians and on public acknowledgment of lesbianism reinforces hetero/sexism, renders lesbian reality invisible, and may contribute to the dangers faced by lesbians who are unwilling to deny the significance of their lesbian relationships. When a patient asks Marilyn if she is married and she replies, “Once upon a time. But that’s a different story,” she is being technically honest, but she is also denying her sexuality and her lover.14 For a lesbian viewer, such denial may be painfully familiar and realistic. For many viewers, however, Marilyn’s response may make it easier to accept her and to indict lesbians who discuss their relationships.\nSuzanne Pharr suggests that heterosexual feminists have often dealt with lesbianism by seeing it as a private issue: “By making it just a bedroom issue (without an attendant homophobia) then people feel free to argue that sex should be private and therefore lesbians can and should keep our sex lives private” (28).\nThe privatization of Marilyn and Patti’s sex life in Heartbeat employs more complexity. As noted earlier, sex in Heartbeat is not wholly defined as private. Heterosexual couples are shown in various sexual encounters in ",
