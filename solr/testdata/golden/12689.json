After having evoked in his concluding remarks, the peculiar relation between Kafka’s insular parable and The Trial, of which it is also a part, Derrida raises the possibility that everything he has developed about the parable might well be included en abyme by the novel, and hence have to be relativized. I shall, however, in the following, leave that possibility aside. If I do so it is not only because Derrida has suggested, in addition ,that “Before the Law” might do “the same thing through a more powerful ellipsis which itself would engulf The Trial, and us along with it”(217) but also because what Derrida says in this reading of the parable about the relation between literature and the law, literature and philosophy, and so forth, contains already in nuce, structurally as it were, the possibility of such a mise en abyme.\nDerrida’s essay is an inquiry into “what and who … decides that Before the Law belongs to what we think we understand under the name of literature”(187). Even though this inquiry is framed by the repeated allusions to a seminar on the moral law and the notion of respect in Kant, Heidegger, and Freud, in which the Kafka story was first discussed, the thrust of the inquiry in question is not philosophical in a general sense, for two reasons. First, and this is, of course, not unimportant, because the philosophical is only invoked under the title of the philosophy of the (moral) law, the philosophy of law, as well as the history of law. Second, even if “it would be tempting, beyond the limits of this reading, to reconstitute this story without story within the elliptic envelope of Kant’s Critique of Practical Reason or Freud’s Totem and Taboo, … we could never explain the parable of a relation called “literary” with the help of semantic contents originating in philosophy or psychoanalyis, or drawing on some other source of knowledge”(209). The question of what and who decides whether Kafka’s story belongs to literature is not to be answered in a philosophically and epistemological fashion, for essential reasons we shall see in just a moment. To become aware of these reasons, let me circle back to the previously mentioned seminar on the Second Critique, in which Derrida reports to have been interested in the status of the example, the symbol, and what Kant calls, in distinction from schematism, the typic of pure practical reason, as well as the role of the “as if” in the second formulation of the categorial ",
