They may merely have “planned” to cope with their misfortunes, come what may, or to deal with life day by day. Considerations of need are distinct from considerations of reliance in Goodin’s sense, and also help to justify some compensation schemes.\nSome compensation programs are actually redistributive. They distribute income more equally than market forces operating alone. Unemployment compensation redistributes income from the employed to the unemployed; workmen’s compensation redistributes income from firms to the disabled. This redistributive function is not removed by the fact that compensation itself is positively correlated with the individuals’ incomes prior to loss. In cases such as these, reliance, autonomy, and need considerations all support the same programs. People need a steady income not just to live out their plans, and to plan out their lives, but also simply to survive.\nThese observations show that Goodin tries to make the concept of reliance do too much work, and in the process prevents his case for the mutual entailment of compensation and redistribution from being as forceful as it could. Compensatory schemes are justified not just because they enable people to carry out plans they have already made, but because they provide people with some of their basic needs and because they promote autonomy, the opportunity to frame long-term plans of life that is secured by creating institutions that make justified reliance possible. The same considerations that justify compensation also justify redistribution in some cases, and in other cases, compensation itself serves redistributive aims. The parsimonious temptation to try to make do with but one moral consideration to account for compensatory practices may thus have weakened Goodin’s case.\nLet us now turn to Goodin’s second claim. Parsimony is not the only reason why Goodin argues that reliance is the sole true principle of compensatory justice. He also believes that if we justify compensatory justice on another ground, that it restores a substantively just situation, then it seems that the very justice of the status quo ante would rule out any redistributive policies. For the ultimate purpose of redistributive justice seems to be ",
