He will be unable to disenchant the animal bride even when she longs to be freed of her animal form and even though her transformation will effectively domesticate her. It would seem that the animal bride cannot become fully human until her would-be deliverer frees himself of his perceptions of her as animal. His fear of her as beast appears to symbolize a more generalized fear of female human sexuality that paralyzes his will: women will almost invariably kiss frog princes, whereas a noteworthy number of men cannot kiss the frog princess.\nA Portuguese story, “The Little Tick,” suggests that men, at the very least, have as much difficulty as women undoing the effects of sexual repression. When the male folklore character spends the night in a palace where he is served a sumptuous if lonely supper, and where “a good bed appeared for him to take his rest,” he is awakened and frightened by coming into contact with something “very cold and clammy.” He “soon became accustomed to the sensation,” however, and begins to hold long conversations with the tick, which, when he agrees to marry her, is transformed into a beautiful woman.151 But in a story from German medieval literature, an enormous pressure must be exerted on Wolfdietrich before he comes to the same point. He “gains his wife by overcoming his natural revulsion against a hairy monster which treads upon his heels,” a “creature” who has the “impudence to demand his love.” When he refuses, she takes her revenge by making him mad, and he wanders the forest as her counterpart, a wild man. Only when he agrees to marry her is he disenchanted—as is she.152 A similar tale from South Africa contains undertones of the swan maiden tale. When a prince sees a green water monster, he “held his breath with horror,” but soon “this hideous creature touched the water [and] the green skin fell away,” there standing in its place the “loveliest maiden he had ever beheld.”153\nFemale werewolves represent the fearfulness of such creatures, but stories about them frequently deny the possibility of disenchantment. In a Persian tale, a man learns that his son is fated to be torn to pieces by a ",
