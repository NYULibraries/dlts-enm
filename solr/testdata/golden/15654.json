Please do not publish my initials and address as I am a respected person in our town and a member of the local church.\nDr. Harold Greenwald responds: I will let this piece of correspondence stand without comment. I only want to note that respect should not be dependent on a person’s sexual tastes, as long, of course, as they do not do harm to others (and in this case, they certainly don’t).\nAfter a few issues, SPIDInfo ceased providing specific AIDS-related information. Yet in the most important sense, the editors remained true to the slogan printed on every issue of the newspaper — “SPID [AIDS] is death. SPIDInfo is life!” — by providing a forum for continuous public discussion of sex. Every few months, SPIDInfo invented a new question-and-answer format.

Samizdat was by then well on its barely legible, carbon-copy way to becoming obsolete. Another year would pass before the press law changed regulations regarding censorship and access to printing and copying technology, but as early as 1989 it was becoming clear that independent publishing would no longer be treated as a crime. The best indicator of this was the number of new publications that suddenly hit the streets, going on sale on the central interchanges of Moscow and St. Petersburg.\nIn 1991, the year following the passage of the Press Law, the Russian ",
