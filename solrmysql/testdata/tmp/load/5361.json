            "pageText": "associates material complexity and the feminine with a multiplicity that characterizations of the feminine and of matter as sameness, stasis, and equilibrium must banish or repudiate in order to imagine the masculine and the symbolic aligned in a position of instrumental mastery over the feminine and over material complexity.\nIn her rethinking and recasting of the feminine as the banished body, Jackson underscores the direct relevance of shifting technics to gendered processes of human subject formation, pointing attention toward the socially and historically contingent processes and apparati through which gendered, sexed, and racialized bodies are allowed or not allowed to mean. In Patchwork Girl and her more recent web-based fiction, Jackson inquires into the processes through which human boundary formation comes about and becomes meaningful and to what social and cultural ends. If digital hypertext provides distinct means of registering modes of material agency and intra-acting with them, it queries, then what is the impact of these technics on the category of the feminine as it relates to both the sexual difference and the gender roles and sexualities that are supposed to follow from material bodies?\nThis is a line of inquiry into the force of sexual difference and other material microagencies that is stopped short by constructivism’s insistence on the absolute divide between cultural discourses of gender and the biological actuality of sex, by the sex/gender system, and, more recently, by cyberfeminist and vitalist theories that, in attempting to read material bodies back into theories of the human, posit a return to a more primary or preexisting organic body (albeit a return facilitated through digital technics). In doing so, the latter collapse the distinction or difference between biological or cultural altogether, eliding the specificity of the relations they enact. Sadie Plant, for instance, describes the intermingling of user and used in digital hypertext, like weaving, as a reconnection with material flows, as “a convergence of organic and nonorganic lives, bodies, machines and brains which had once seemed so absolutely separate. Any remaining distinctions between users and used, man and his tools, nature, culture, and technology collapsed into the microprocessings of soft machines spiraling into increasing proximity.”85 In this passage and elsewhere in Plant’s work, the difference between organic systems and cognitive systems completely disappears, which leaves no option of inquiring into their differential, dynamic, enactive modes of interrelation. In putting the feminine in touch with a material flow, Plant ignores important differences between these bodies and seemingly positivizes the feminine in its direct relation to material complexity. Understood in terms of its proximity to material flows, the category of the feminine is easily",
