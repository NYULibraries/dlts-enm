            "pageText": "Such a “necrospective” vision both accords with and departs from posthumanist theorizations of chaos and evolution.51 To take one example: in revealing himself to be nothing more or less than an assemblage of various states of “matter-energy,” Adams anticipates Manuel DeLanda’s undermining of the false essentialization and “reified totalit[y]” of the individual.52 Like Adams, DeLanda insists that persons are “emergent propert[ies]” of the organic and inorganic strata that compose them.53 Moreover, both Adams and DeLanda extend this insight beyond the individual to implicate the entire “human species . . . as . . . a contingent historical production,” the inevitable consequence of which is to “allow physics to infiltrate human history.”54\n        Yet where the emphasis in DeLanda, building on Ilya Prigogine’s repurposing of entropy, is on “matter’s inherent creativity,” on how assemblages come to be through nonlinear, nonteleological processes, Adams’s focus is on decreation, on how orders—personal, social, cosmic—dissolve.55 Perhaps these positions represent two sides of the same coin, reflecting what James would call only a difference of “temper.”56 It is, however, a difference that matters. Although DeLanda explicitly cautions that thermodynamic evolution neither can “be viewed as . . . [moving through] progressively more sophisticated stages . . . that culminat[e] in humanity as its crowning achievement” nor can “guarantee . . . a golden age ahead,” he nevertheless locates “a new kind of hope” in the “positive, even joyful” project of “destratify[ing] reality itself”—a project based in finding “the pragmatic uses of” thinking in terms of heterogeneous processes.57 In this, DeLanda is joined by Elizabeth Grosz, Keith Ansell Pearson, and numerous other theorists seeking to “reconceptualiz[e] the dynamics of political change and social and cultural upheaval” by basing them in “the unpredictable . . . [and] nondeterministic” events of temporal and material flux.58 By converting universal indeterminacy into a praxis of personal and collective liberation, they open new horizons of “endless becoming.”59 It is an idea, of course, that originates not in our age but in Adams’s, where Bergson, James, and others link the “creative evolution” of the cosmos—“the most intimate secre[t] of life”—to the revitalization of ourselves.60\n        Adams, however, refuses such comfort. Where others believe universal process to be inherently democratic, Adams sees only the ",
