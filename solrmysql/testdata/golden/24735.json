            "pageText": "I was lost. I kept running, past my motionless classmates, searching each face for some clue. But there was nothing there.\nI was still sprinting at midfield when, for no apparent reason, I threw the ball high in the air, as high as I could, and the effort caused me to fall awkwardly to the ground. I felt like I was hurt, but I got up quickly and kept on running, back to my end of the field, to my original position, where I stood in place for the rest of the recess.\nI only moved once after that, when a ball was kicked right at me. I raised my hands to catch it, but managed only to knock it to the ground, and a bunch of the other kids yelled, “Hands! Hands!” and pointed at me, and they ran up and snatched the ball from where it had landed at my feet. I was left standing there feeling very little and very skinny and very stupid and oddly ashamed. I did not say a word to anyone as we filed back into school when recess was over. And nobody said a word to me.\nA few days later we played softball at recess. Except I didn’t play. I didn’t get picked to be on a team. So I sat behind the backstop and watched, along with all the girls in the class and one very pale boy who wore glasses even thicker than mine. The class played softball almost every day after that, and I never got picked, and neither did any of the girls or the very pale boy, who always brought a book out during recess, which started to make some sense.\nSometime during the second or third week of school, after yet another miserable recess, our teacher asked us which baseball team was going to win the National League pennant. He went around the room asking the kids, except he didn’t ask every kid, only the boys, and each boy would say a team, almost always the Phillies, and the girls would all yell, “Yea!” cheering the kid for picking the Phillies, despite the fact that the Phillies were twenty games out of first place with just ten games left to play. Around the room he went, and the boys would say, “the Phillies,” and the girls would say, “Yea!” until he got to some kid named Brad, who said he thought the Reds would win the pennant, because they led by two games and they had the pitching needed to hold on down the stretch, and the other kids oohed and ahhed at Brad’s superior knowledge. The teacher called on the next boy, who quickly said, “the Phillies” and the girls again said, “Yea!”\nThen the teacher got to me.\n“Bobby, who do you think will win the pennant?”\n",
