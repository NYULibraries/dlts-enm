She said, “After all, you are against this war, you do not have to go because of your age.” Despite his initial objection to the war, Dov decided to serve so that he would be able to help victims of Israeli aggression, and was at the age of sixty-eight the oldest soldier to serve in the Lebanon War.\nDov was emotionally torn by the inner conflict involved in joining an evil system in order to minimize the suffering of others. He maintained the belief that even in an unpleasant situation a person as an individual can do significant good. Such feelings occur frequently among altruistic people (Staub 1984). In many of his writings during and after the war, Yirmiya continually returns to the fact that he joined the “Operation,” even though he knew it was fundamentally wrong. In a lecture he gave in December 1984 at the Forum, one of the most respected platforms at Tel-Aviv University, he openly criticized Israel’s actions. “The Lebanon War—from the moral and diplomatic viewpoints as well as from the way it had been waged—is the result of Herut leaders’ delusions of grandeur; as such, it found its classic expression in the rhetoric of one of the greatest demagogues in Jewish history, Menachem Begin. He, and the terrifying creature he fostered, launched the IDF on a crusade combining the Star of David and the Phalangist cross, according to a scenario that only a sick imagination could have dreamt up. The crusade failed, and the unholy alliance was doomed before it even began.… Only an army whose commanders were devoid of all restraint of conscience and morality, immersed in nationalism and racism, could have ignored its human responsibility and obligation according to the law of nations, in its handling of noncombatant populations in conquered territories—as indeed the IDF has done in this war” (see also Schiff and Yaari 1984).\nYirmiya’s verbal and writing style is, as can be seen here, very dramatic. Most of his writings have the flavor of drama. He adds, “the description is ruthless—reality was much more so. This realization is exceedingly hard for someone like myself, who spent his entire life assuring a safe refuge for his sisters and brothers, in absolute faith that my country would be democratic.” Later in the same lecture, he pointed out that not all is black:\nThroughout this insane war, despite the prevailing spirit of hatred and revenge promoted by the political leaders and high command, there were thousands of soldiers and officers who fought and behaved in a humanitarian way.… They looked at the other side and saw not only the enemy, ",
