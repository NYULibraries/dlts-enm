            "pageText": "directs the individual gay man’s control of himself. By internalizing his homosexual self as Other—and by internalizing this self in the language of the Other—the gay man denies himself the possibility of genuine subversion of his culture, at least in the sense that he demand it recognize his sexuality as a component of all sexuality.\nIf White’s novels contribute anything to our thinking about gay identity, it may be the recognition that it is impossible to subvert the present cultural framework from within the discourses that define it. Though there are moments in A Boy’s Own Story and The Beautiful Room when an apparently self-authenticating authorial voice breaks into the narrative to reflect ironically upon the thoughts and deeds of the narrator, the voice remains nothing more than that of the adult explaining the child. And though the ending of The Beautiful Room holds forth an apparent promise of liberation, neither that promise nor reality itself has solved the problem of the gay man’s enforced separation from the society that creates and nurtures him. In a sense, then, the novel written before White’s political conversion, Nocturnes, provides a sobering commentary on the political optimism of the last works. Its ghostlike narrator reminds us that beneath the rhetoric of liberation through self-defining community lies the complex and perhaps intractable problems of gay identity in post-Stonewall America. Seen in this light, the novels become powerful documents in our understanding of the roles gay men in America have been forced to play. Despite the freedom celebrated in gay polemic, White’s novels reveal a still rocky landscape of gender relations.\nNotes\n1. The still-contested idea that homosexuality as we understand it did not exist until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is confirmed by Bray (1982) and Halpern (1990), among others.\n2. Foucault and other post-structuralist thinkers would deny the possibility of selfdefining choice that lies at the heart of Sartre’s thought. It is not my purpose here to try to reconcile opposing points of view. Rather, I would suggest that although we might conceive the history of the homosexual as the history of his fabrication as a Subject, the vocabulary of existentialist philosophy provides a useful measure of the terms of the discourse that subjects him. As I will make clear in the conclusion, though Sartre’s theory helps clarify White’s work, these novels—in the long run—interrogate Sartre.\n",
