Now it’s all right; we know what will happen from now on.\nThe flight itself was uneventful. At one point, we were alerted that some missiles were chasing us. We followed instructions, namely we didn’t try to evade the missiles because our electronic warfare devices were supposed to take care of that. We were well disciplined and followed our orders, against our instincts, one may say, which warned us to escape. So the missile approached and was indeed exploded by our devices. However, the explosion was much too close to the aircraft, and we were hit as well. We released the bombs so that we’d be lighter in order to escape, and we turned back, toward the east.\nWe didn’t notice fire or smoke in the cockpit, but it was clear that pieces of the missile had hit the plane. We tried to lower our altitude and speed up, and this was in fact possible, once we got rid of the extra weight of the bombs. Ten seconds before crossing the canal, the plane suddenly tilted left and downward, and Chetz was saying in the intercom, “Here it goes.” I understood that we had lost control, and immediately raised my hand to pull the ejection cord. I don’t know if Chetz was doing the same, but at any rate, my act should have ejected both of us, with me going first. I was out, and since we were quite low then and at high speed, I was wounded by the blast. I suppose Chetz didn’t make it. The plane exploded and he was killed.\nThe Egyptians never returned his body. … Three and a half years later, after the Yom Kippur War, we returned to the location and found several human bones there. So we gave him a funeral. [His voice is very sad.]\nFrom the moment we were hit, until I jumped, I remember a sense of control, even calm. All my senses were completely clear. I wasn’t afraid of anything anymore. The moment I was ejected, however, I lost consciousness, because of the speed. I regained consciousness for a second when the parachute opened above me. With the pull of the cable, I detached myself from the chair and fainted again. I woke up on the ground.\nI would like to add that the moment of jumping is a strange one. You are actually shot out of the aircraft, and you feel like ",
