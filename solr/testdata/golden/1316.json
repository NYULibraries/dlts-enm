The author has the first rights to the harvests born from his land.9 But, historically, agrarian societies have shifted from the model of an individual or small group of individuals who toil together on their land for sustenance toward a commercialized, technologically driven business model. Today's crops have been planted, tended, harvested, and shipped thanks to the combined assistance of hundreds, even thousands, of workers. Similarly, today's texts are the collective efforts of many individuals working in concert. Though ownership rights of texts are afforded to the primary author, these rights often do not take into account the various individuals who assisted in the communal creation and dissemination of the text.\nIn many respects, we believe that wikis embody some of the best features of this new communal production model: they are community built, edited, and sustained. Wikis reflect both the values and the needs of specific communities or users. For example, most wikis have some form of code of conduct as well as rules and regulations that help shape the work contained within. Wikis are not, as commonly believed, uncontrolled and unfettered, with no sense of authorial or editorial control. On the contrary, most wikis have distinct hierarchies of users; each individual has a part to play. Though the memberships of these roles are not static, many of the positions themselves remain constant and often overlap: owner, editor, reviewer, proofreader, moderator, problem solver. Even defining and deciding what content stays and what goes is a communal decision, one that can be hotly debated. Like other collective systems, wikis depend on the shared responsibilities of the users who make up the community. Therefore, though different models exist for the creation and editing of wikis, they all rely in large part upon individuals working in harmony to create the best content they feel they can offer.\nWikis in the Classroom: Collaboration and the Creation of Knowledge\nIf wikis are so well suited to collaborative writing, it remains to be seen why more instructors aren't using them. If wikis are simple to set up and use, what holds people back? The perceived lack of control coupled with the potential\n",
