In such an atmosphere, purity itself could not escape contamination.”17\nThere are, to be sure, rational reasons for protesting such conditions, but there is also an obsessional-compulsive undercurrent to these protests. For the reformers were objecting to confusion, and confusion may lie at the heart of what we imagine as dirt. As Mary Douglas explains: “For us dirt is a kind of compendium category for all events which blur, smudge, contradict, or otherwise confuse accepted classifications.”18 In a similar vein, psychoanalyst Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel emphasizes that forbidden mixtures, mixtures that confound dissimilar things, are the essence of anality. The prototype of such chaotic mixtures is excrement, a homogeneous blend of substances that were originally distinct. In contrast to the Biblical world of division and separation stands this “universe of perversion.”19\nIf one sign of the obsessional theme in prison reform is a revulsion from the indiscriminate mingling of the old-style prisons, another is the preoccupation with order and separation in the new prisons. This preoccupation can be seen in the following passage from the First Annual Report of the Boston Prison Discipline Society, written in 1826:\n\nAt Auburn, we have a more beautiful example still, of what may be done by proper discipline, in a Prison well constructed. . . . The whole establishment, from the gate to the sewer, is a specimen of neatness. The unremitted industry, the entire subordination and subdued feeling of the convicts, has probably no parallel among an equal number of criminals. In their solitary cells they spend the night, with no other book than the Bible, and at sunrise they proceed, in military order, under the eye of the turnkeys, in solid columns, with the lock march, to their work-shops; then, in the same order, at the hour of breakfast, to the common hall, where they partake of their wholesome and frugal meal in silence. Not even a whisper is heard through the whole apartment.20\n\nIn a detail that brings to mind the French expression la manie de précision, the report goes on to describe how convicts were obliged ",
