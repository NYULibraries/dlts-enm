(1919, 162)\nFreud’s advocacy of abstinence and frustration (in an implicitly asymmetrical authoritarian relationship) contrasts with Ferenczi’s description of “mutual analysis” where the emphasis is on safety and symmetry. Initially, in the early 1920s, Ferenczi wholeheartedly embraced Freud’s technical principle of abstinence. Indeed, Ferenczi is well known for his “active technique,” which consisted of tension-heightening demands and prohibitions that he imposed on patients in stalemated analyses. After renouncing his “active technique” in the mid-1920s, however, Ferenczi went to the opposite extreme by adopting what he called the “relaxation technique” (1930). With this approach—less often discussed than his “active technique”—Ferenczi tried to gratify the patient’s longings while minimizing his own demands. He tried to create a “safe” atmosphere in which the patient felt totally accepted and trusting, hoping thereby to enable the patient to reexperience the emotions originating in traumatic childhood experiences. Ferenczi’s technique of “relaxation” contained an implicit reenactment of his conception of the idealized early mother-infant bond, characterized by an ambience of total acceptance and indulgence of the help-seeking, traumatized child-within-the-analysand (Hoffer 1991).\nBecause of its relevance to our inquiry into asymmetry and mutuality, I shall now consider the problem of whether feelings in the analytic relationship—for example, transferential and countertransferential feelings of love—are real. The questions to ponder include: How is a psychoanalytic relationship different from an ordinary relationship? Is an ordinary relationship real and an analytic relationship—with its analysis of transferential feelings—unreal? Are transferential feelings unreal? In contrast to transferential feelings, are feelings in the therapeutic alliance, like those in an ordinary relationship, real?\nIn the last decade, psychoanalysts have asked: “Whose reality is it?” (Modell 1991; Schwaber 1992). They have thereby placed a renewed emphasis on understanding the patient’s psychic reality and on the construction of reality during the therapeutic process by the analyst as well as by the analysand. A brief review of the shifts in psychoanalytic theory and technique will put our questions about asymmetry and mutuality into sharper ",
