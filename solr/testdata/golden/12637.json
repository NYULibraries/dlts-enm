            "pageText": "poses that such parody “effectively mark the body politic” and that it successfully avoid becoming a “parody of a parody.” The latter phrase is curious, for it seems to suggest that if parody, which in and of itself already entails a movement of repetition, seeks to truly disconcert or deconstruct, it must not cede too readily or too much to this self-same repetition, which otherwise will render it the “parody of a parody.” Would such a parody—parody of a parody—itself be more or less parodic than parody itself? The latter, it seems, can hope “to effectively mark the body politic” while the former, on the other hand, would only reinforce that body, repeating it in an identical manner. In any case, the question of parody in relation to repetition has been raised.\nTwelve years after the Nietzsche Decade at Cérisy, this question returns. This time, however, the context is quite different: the point of departure, and perhaps also of arrival, is the repetition of the “yes” in Joyce’s Ulysses. Joyce, Derrida emphasizes, is a writer who has haunted his own writing ever since its inception: “Yes, each time that I write … and even within the academic domain, a ghost of Joyce is always on board.”6 It is not entirely fortuitous if one of the initial instances of this “boarding” concerns the relation between history and language.7 But let us now turn to the “return” of parody in this text on Joyce. Once again, parody seems to impose itself inexorably by virtue of its tie to a certain essential repetition of language:\nThe repetition of the yes can assume mechanical, servile forms, bending the woman to her master. But this is not by accident, even if every response to another as to a singular other should, it seems, escape such a fate. The yes of affirmation, of assent or of consent, of alliance, engagement, signature or of the gift should bear repetition in itself in order to merit its meaning (pour valoir ce qu’il vaut). It should immediately confirm its promise and promise its confirmation. This essential repetition allows itself to be haunted by the intrinsic threat, the interior telephone of the parasite, as its mimetic-mechanical double, as its incessant parody, (p. 89)\nHere, in commenting on Joyce’s text, the general problematic of the iterability of every mark singularizes itself in an ambivalent manner: if all affirmation, every affirmative response should repeat itself, or at least be capable of repetition, this iterability, ",
