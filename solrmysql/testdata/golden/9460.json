            "pageText": "that disturbed me so much. I think that the democratic process might have oppressed the minority in a cruel manner; for if nine men agree on a certain question, let’s say on drinking coffee out of old jam jars, it’s easier on them because they’re together on this. The tenth man, however, feels trapped, really beaten. Not only is he miserable because he’s alone, but due to the external circumstances there’s no way for him to get out of this group. That was why I argued that we should take into consideration the single person, rather than the nine. But my argument sounded like Greek to the others. The guys couldn’t comprehend it. Yet I felt that had my principle been accepted, it would have solved some of the hardships of the weaker members of the group. Imagine that by the majority rule they had decided to read only the kibbutz Haggada on Passover, because that was Rami’s wish, and he was the unquestioned leader of the company. Had this been the case, I would have rebelled against the majority. I would have sat outside and not participated in the Seder. But all the same, the democratic solution was the best in most cases.\nOnce Rami and myself agreed on a matter, there was no question it would be adopted by the group, since together we were completely dominant, each in his own way.

I think we should all be grateful for that, because had they stayed with Rami alone, they would have all eventually fallen asleep. When I joined the group, I formed a new focus of power, and thus changed the former equilibrium. I pushed forward, whereas Rami supported the people and formed them into a kibbutz-like group based on equality and cooperation. I don’t think there was an individual in our group that I didn’t respect. I had arguments with Rami about that, too. He used to scold me: “Why do you keep arguing with Benny, leave him alone!” I said that by arguing with him, I was demonstrating my respect for him, because it proved that I considered him a worthy opponent, and that I was not lowering myself to his level.
