At the time of the Rodney King uprising, Los Angeles was dealing with the contradictory results of its place as the nation’s missile manufacturer. Reagan’s Cold War build up in the early 1980s was being dismantled in the early 1990s. Almost 1.5 million jobs were shed, including the disappearance of a hundred thousand jobs in aerospace (layoffs followed the “last hired, first fired” paradigm, hitting Black and Latino workers hardest). All told, Los Angeles lost 20 percent of its manufacturing jobs, 40 percent of which had been unionized.6\nReagan’s Cold War spending and the post–Cold War military restructuring was accompanied by a steady dismantling of social welfare. Overall federal spending per capita declined nearly 14 percent in real terms from 1983 to 1996. Medicare, payments to veterans, and housing investments all declined while Medicaid spending increased some 200 percent and crime spending soared nearly 700 percent.7 By 1993 California’s official poverty rate stood at 18.2 percent, while the rate in South Central was higher than in 1965. Over one-quarter of children lived in poverty.8\nSpiraling medical costs and the failure of health insurance—fully one-third of Los Angeles residents did not have private or public insurance coverage—led to the closure of outpatient clinics. Emergency rooms became the primary care provider of first and last resort. In turn, almost thirty private emergency rooms and ten private trauma centers in the county closed their doors, leaving the burden on the public sector. Eighty-three percent of the 4 million emergency room and clinic visits to the county’s public health care system in 1991–92 were made by people without insurance.9\nOne thing that is not often remembered about 1992 is that South LA gangs the Crips and Bloods signed a historic peace treaty before the uprising. In its aftermath, young Black gang members called for jobs. “Give Us the Bricks and Mortar,” they said, “and We Will Rebuild LA.” These gang members’ efforts should be read in line with earlier attempts on the part of antiwar and antiracist movements to build a just city. Unfortunately, when the U.S. Conference of Mayors that same year called for a “Marshall Plan” for massively reinvesting in cities, their election-year appeal was met with virtual silence from Republicans and Democrats alike.10\nThrough the 2000s, defense spending outstripped domestic budgets by an average of 8 percent, four times faster than increases in spending on the mandatory programs Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, and twenty-seven times faster than other discretionary programs, such as housing and ",
