The report was well-documented and provoked an instant reaction from Chinese authorities, always prepared for crisis management, in which they announced that local officials would be punished, businesses closed, and the contracts immediately terminated.\nOne of the striking features of the report is the way in which it shows how traditional IOC rhetoric can be deployed to create a frame for altering narratives.
