            "pageText": "whose immigrant parents have given them such a strong diet of their native culture and traditions that their gender role definitions and religious and moral values, despite their having grown up in the United States, seem closer to my grandmother’s than to my own.31 And if, when I teach Asian-American literature, students assume that “I am what I teach” and expect me to ratify their stereotype that all Asian women are docile, or that all have arranged marriages and bound feet, or that (in order to assert my ethnic identity) I should dress exotically, I refuse to oblige. Besides, at different moments I often find it easier to identify both with fictional protagonists and with students who are completely different from me on one or more categories—of class, gender, race, sexuality, religion, nationality, citizenship, and so on—but with whom I can easily “connect” intellectually and/or emotionally.\nThe fallacies in the assumption that we cannot teach “what we are not” are too many to enumerate. If the idea is carried to its logical conclusion, it would imply that only men can teach men’s texts, only women must teach women’s texts, only the British can teach British literature, and so on. The entire question of identity as based on categories such as “race” and “culture” is tenuous. It would even imply that we are not able to teach texts written in a different historical period; for instance, surely, a Norwegian-American or Irish-American male professor in the late twentieth century is not part of fifth-century B.C. Greek culture, or of Renaissance Italy. How could he then teach about the same? 32 A Jewish-American woman is not a male poet living in nineteenth-century England. How can she then “teach what she is not”—works by Wordsworth, or Shelley, or Browning? Similarly, a working-class African American female professor’s identity and experiences have little in common (except her skin color) with those of an upper-class male Nigerian novelist (or with his fictional protagonists); and a lesbian teacher is very different from the heterosexual authors whose works she may wish to teach.
