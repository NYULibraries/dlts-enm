Saying the words might provide some release, but their utterance was often accompanied by a carefully reassuring grin designed to confirm that no real emotional rules violation had been intended.15\nSports, shopping, and escapist fiction provided three other outlets, often combined with more open sexuality and looser language, in which intensity could be sought outside normal emotional life. These outlets tended to promote a growing quest for the excitement that Victorians had sought in passion. And by being disconnected from the usual rules, they also fostered a certain passivity in which acts and products offered by others might substitute for direct experience.\nConsumerism was hardly new in the twentieth century. Elements of it surely date back to the first uses of economic surplus in human life, particularly in emerging upper classes, and a modern form of more extensive, expressive consumerism has been plausibly traced to the eighteenth century, when acquisition of things like stylish clothing began to play a new role in Western society.16 In the twentieth century, however, consumerism became more widespread, commanding new uses of time and fostering new environments like shopping centers and then malls. It also became, in its own way, more intense. The new emotional culture deliberately fostered surrogate attachment to objects as a means of preventing emotional intensity among people. Thus, as a means of curbing sibling jealousy, children were taught to turn to their own things and to expect new ones. Adult men were offered consumerism as a preferred alternative to intense romantic love, and the newly touted companionate marriage emphasized shared enjoyment of acquisitions. The act of shopping began to acquire a potential passion of its own, particularly for middle-class women. At an extreme, the passion could turn to kleptomania, in which the intense yearning for goods surpassed both any real economic need and the law itself.17 Theft aside, it was now permissible to invest emotional meaning in the act of acquisition and in the objects acquired. American advertising and merchandising carefully stressed ultimate equality of access, and as a result consumerism was not seen as violating democratic standards or directly leading to envy.18 This further legitimized an attachment to things that might easily surpass the newly constrained attachments to people. Revealingly, new emotional involvements with pets accompanied the growing interest in things. Surely the vital connection between consumerism and emotional culture helps explain consumerism itself, a dominant phenomenon of twentieth-century ",
