Spurgeon, Shakespeare’s Imagery and What It Tells Us (1935; reprint, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1968), 159–61 (showing that Shakespeare conceived of evil as dirty, black, and diseased); Gary S. Morson, “Verbal Pollution in The Brothers Karamazov,” in Critical Essays on Dostoevsky, ed. Robin Miller (Boston: G. K.

According to the latest figures from the United States Department of Justice, 1.2 million persons were held in local jails or in state or federal prisons in 1991. See U.S. Department of Justice, Correctional Populations in the United States, 1991 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, 1993), 1.11.\n5. See, e.g., Norval Morris and Michael Tonry, Between Prison and Probation (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), 6–9 (“[T]here is general agreement about the need to expand ‘intermediate punishments,’” such as “intensive probation, the fine, the community service order”); Fox Butterfield, “Are American Jails Becoming Shelters from the Storm?” New York Times, 19 July 1992, sec. E, p. 4 (citing Norval Morris, who believes that “increased imprisonment has made no difference in the crime rate,” and citing exorbitant expenditures on new prisons); Don Terry, “More Familiar, Life in Cell Seems Less Terrible,” New York Times, 13 September 1992, sec. A, p. 1 (quoting New Haven police chief Nicholas Pastore on the “mean-spirited system of justice” that warehouses criminals but lacks genuine concern for them); Joseph B. Treaster, “Two U.S. Judges, Protesting Policies, Are Declining to Take Drug Cases,” New York Times, 17 April 1993, sec. A, p. 7 (discussing two prominent judges who refuse to preside over drug cases to protest our society’s emphasis on arrests and imprisonment).\n6. Thus, Judge Richard Posner cites our “exceptionally severe criminal punishments (many for intrinsically minor, esoteric, or archaic offenses)” as one of the factors making the United States “one of the most penal of the civilized nations . . . a disturbing state of affairs.” Review of Hitler’s Justice: The Courts of the Third Reich, by Ingo Muller, The New Republic 204 (1991): 42. On a more specific level, Judge Harold Greene recently declared the Federal Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional as applied to a defendant in a drug case. The defendant had been convicted of possessing about one-fourth of an ounce of heroin and cocaine—an offense requiring thirty-years’ imprisonment, according to the Guidelines. Sentencing the defendant to ten years in prison, Judge Greene observed that the mandated sentence was “grossly out of proportion to the seriousness” of the crime. He added, “We cannot allow justice and rationality to become casualties of a war on drugs being waged with Draconian, politically expedient sentences.” Michael York, “Judge Rejects Federal Sentencing Guidelines; Mandatory 30-Year Imprisonment for Repeat Drug Offender Called Unconstitutional,” Washington Post, 30 April 1993, sec. D, p. 5.\n7. For the idea of feces as an artistic creation, consider the following incident: ",
