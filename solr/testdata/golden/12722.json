            "pageText": "to moralize that pain is one which isolates a subject as the intentional originator of an injurious deed; Nietzsche understands this, first, as the moralization by which pain and injury are rendered equivalent and, second, as the production of a domain of painful effects suffused with conjectured intention. At such a moment the subject is not only fabricated as the prior and causal origin of a painful effect that is recast as an injury, but the action whose effects are injurious is no longer an action, the continuous present of a doing, but is reduced to a ‘singular act.’\nThe following citation from On the Genealogy of Morals is usually read with an emphasis on the retroactive positing of the doer prior to the deed; but note that simultaneous with this retroactive positing is a moral resolution of a continuous “doing” into a periodic “deed”: “there is no ‘being’ behind doing, effecting, becoming; ‘the doer’ is merely a fiction added to the deed—the deed is everything”. “. . . es gibt kein ‘Sein’ hinter dem Tun, Wirken, Werden; ‘der Täter’ ist zum Tun bios hinzugedichtet—das Tun ist alles.” In the German, there is no reference to an “act”—die Tat—but only to a doing, “das Tun,” and to the word for a culprit or wrong-doer, “der Täter,” which translates merely as a “doer.”2 Here the very terms by which “doing” is retroactively fictionalized (hinzugedichtet) as the intentional effect of a “subject,” establishes the notion of a “doer” primarily as a wrong-doer. Furthermore, in order to attribute accountability to a subject, an origin of action in that subject is Actively secured. In the place of a “doing” there appears the grammatical and juridical constraint on thought by which a subject is produced first and foremost as the accountable originator of an injurious deed. A moral causality is thus set up between the subject and its act such that both terms are separated off from a more temporally expansive “doing” that appears to be prior and oblivious to these moral requirements.\nFor Nietzsche, the subject appears only as a consequence of a demand for accountability; a set of painful effects is taken up by a moral framework that seeks to isolate the “cause” of those effects in a singular and intentional agent, a moral framework that operates through a certain economy of paranoid fabrication and efficiency. The question, then, of who is accountable for a given injury ",
