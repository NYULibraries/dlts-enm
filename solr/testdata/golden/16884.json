Activities and relations originally adopted purely for the sake of their external payoffs may come, perhaps through association with those payoffs and perhaps by tapping an unrecognized interest in those activities or relations, also to be valued in themselves. (Recall the previously noted capacity of people complexly to intermingle internal and instrumental sexual motivations.) People who join firms for the sake of the salaries and retirement benefits develop valued personal ties and institutional loyalties. Owners of car-repair shops may quite calculatingly set out to be friendly with and have a personal relation with their customers; their customers, in turn, may cunningly invest some time and effort in developing these personal relations. Yet that does not mean that some comfortably low-keyed bond of mutual recognition and confidence will not ensue.21 I assume that Radin does not mean to deny this inter-penetration of what is instrumentally and what is intrinsically valued when she writes that “Commercial friendship is a contradiction in terms.”22\nIt is, of course, always possible to develop a disproportionate occupation with the means one employs toward one’s further ends, be it with money, or vitamins, or the favor of those in authority. So, in a society in which money is a key means for achieving ends, fears about the commodification of activities and relations that should be valued for their own sake are not fantastic. There are features of our society that may dim people’s perception of the values internal to certain ways of acting and relating to other people. There is a consequentialist mentality, strongly exemplified by but hardly the product of or confined to Chicago economics, that portrays the value of actions and relations as entirely derivative of their consequent, external payoffs. Given this perspective, actions performed in the market for the sake of their financial payoff may come to be seen as paradigmatic of all rational action. Dovetailing with this perception is the appeal of money as the best candidate—which is not to say that it is a good candidate—for a common standard by which most, if not all, of our endeavors can be measured against one another. The plausibility of money as the measure of all things—if there is to be a measure of all things—is further ",
