Well into his presidency, Clinton was still claiming that he had gone to Washington determined to work with Democrats and Republicans, “but had been shocked to find out people say ‘Well, I’m not going to work with you because you’re in the other party … we have to oppose you … it’s the political thing to do’” (Clinton 1995f, 1499). This view discounts Clinton’s own contribution to the Republican’s concerns with his budget priorities and his decision not to modify them.\n20. An example arose in connection with administration debates on keeping or abandoning the energy tax in their economic plan. All four consultants were key figures at the White House meetings that began in the Solarium on July 3, 1992, around the issue of the energy tax and Clinton’s budget. During the campaign, when all four consultants agreed, “they would virtually dictate the decision” (Woodward 1994, 251). However, in this debate the consultants were split. Some argued for retaining the energy tax, others argued it was too politically costly (Woodward 1994, 245–57). In the face of disagreements among his consultants Clinton had difficulty adhering to a position, first supporting, then abandoning any form of energy tax.\n21. The differences between the Clinton estimates and the CBO estimate, though large, are the result of small differences in estimating costs and savings, which because of the large numbers involved become magnified over time (Rosenbaum 1995). Yet both sets of figures make the assumption that there will be no economic slowdowns or recessions in the next ten years, a fairly optimistic assumption. Therefore, both sets of figures are likely to underestimate the amount of the deficit, the Clinton budget by more than the CBO estimates.\nFormer CBO director Robert Reichauer said much of the progress claimed by the administration comes from “defining a problem that’s much smaller than the one Congress is addressing” (Allen 1995). He further notes that the administrations projections are “on the optimistic side, and if achieving balance is an important objective, Congress’s assumptions are certainly more prudent.”\n22. During the campaign Clinton promised to cut the federal deficit, at the time estimated at $194 billion, in half in four years. However, by late July 1992 it had climbed to $254 billion. Drew notes in this regard that although “the Clinton people were perfectly aware of this new number they had not revised their campaign pledge, or even acknowledged the change” (1994, 59; see also Woodward 1994, 76–77). One Clinton economic adviser told Drew, “The campaign knew about it, but didn’t want to talk about it.” After the election, the worsening budget picture was one rationale that Clinton gave for having to go back on his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut.\n23. For example, the conference organizers put liberal economist James Tobin on the program to present his argument for a $60 billion stimulus program, “so ",
