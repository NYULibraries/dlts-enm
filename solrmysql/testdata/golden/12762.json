So that they cease to be—a truly amazing conclusion—women. Instead of lowering their eyes under the male gaze, and blushing bashfully, they look straight back into mens’ eyes to control and test the effect they have as women.\nThe least feminine women are the aristocrats. And this not despite, but because they generously expose their female charms, overexposing their femininity, so to speak. Femininity here shows its true face: far from being natural, it turns out to be a masquerade. They wear too much rouge, paint their breasts, have vertiginous plunging décolletés; their shamelessness is such that Rousseau shrinks from describing them to his bashful Julie. Exposed femininity does not signify “woman,” but “aristocrat.”: “Thus, they cease to be women out of fear of being confounded with other women; prefering their rank to their sex they imitate whores so as not to be imitated.”12 The Parisian aristocrats not only make themselves up all too evidently as women; in addition they reflect the process by which they become objects of desire—two unveilings too much, for Rousseau’s taste. Since femininity consists in this double veiling, there is little left of it among the women of the beau monde. For Rousseau, art consists in hiding art: Ars adeo latet arte sua, as Ovid already knew. Parisian women have unfortunately forgotten all about it. Art, which hides itself and its own doing, is necessary however to establish male subjectivity.\nTherefore, according to Rousseau, woman is not the complement but rather the very condition of the male subject. It is the condition for his belief in literal properness, for the establishment of the figure of “man” and its concealment. The supplement, to quote Derrida, floods the being. The artful erasure of the female self—Rousseau does not tire to assure us—is in the very best interest of women. The more unmediated they appear, the greater their effect. Their rhetorical skills should only be used so that the man learns to play his “rôle d’homme.” Woman should erase herself so that man can learn to know and love himself in others—“ses semblables,” says Rousseau—and these others are always the same: men.\nThe self-erasure of feminity, which should function only as ",
