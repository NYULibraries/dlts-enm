            "pageText": "INTERVIEWER: Owning and managing a store, is that something your parents always wanted to do?\nTEASE: We were struggling financially. I remember that. We were eating, like, corned beef everyday and I was just like “What is this?” … They were financially struggling and the [Filipino grocery] store has been in our family since 1981, and actually even prior to that. My uncle, who came here first, he came here first and then he passed it down to his younger brother who passed it down to us. … I mean he loved the store—don’t get me wrong—but he fell in love with this great aunt of mine, and it’s like “Oh, screw that. I want a family. Here you go. You can have the store.” It was really big for my parents then.9\n\nAccording to Tease, her parents no longer have to worry about money after taking over the store. They now have the means to live comfortably and do whatever it is they want, like investing in property and traveling all around the globe.\nOne Tyme was born in San Francisco, California, in 1982. Her parents were born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States in their teens. They first settled in San Francisco and have been there since the late 1970s. Her father is a bellboy at a Holiday Inn while her mother is an accountant. The only child in the family, One Tyme is a student at UC Berkeley, where she majors in ethnic studies and teaches a class on the basics of DJing.10\nSoup-a-Crunk was born in San Francisco, California, in 1979. Like my other respondents, his parents were born in the Philippines. The family immigrated to the United States in 1978 and initially settled in San Francisco in order to be close to relatives—an uncle and grandparents—before they moved to Oakland, a recurrent pattern among my respondents. Soup-a-Crunk’s father is a tailor while his mother works for the air quality management district. Soup-a-Crunk is the youngest of six children and is the only one of them born in the United States. One sister works at a law firm and another works with his mother in air quality management. Soup-a-Crunk also has three older brothers—one is a mechanic and machinist, another is a security guard, and the third works at Home Depot. He graduated from UC Berkeley and plans to pursue a career in film.11\nEntry into DJ Culture\nFor my respondents, growing up in a DJ mecca like the Bay Area meant spending their formative years around DJs who introduced them to DJing at an early age and encouraged them to become DJs themselves. Cousins, friends, and neighbors already into DJing proved to have had a profound influence on their decision to become DJs.\n\n",
