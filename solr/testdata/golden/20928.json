At nineteen, she wore drag down to her underwear, and her neckties were raw silk and her gold monogrammed ring came down to her from her godmother. She comes by everything naturally.\nThe question is: when is a romantic fantasy, all of it, not shaped to persuade a lover? The answer is: when she strikes out in some motion pertaining to walking, to moving on; while, simultaneously, her right shoulder reserves itself in stillness.\n\nCyrica and Julitta were daughter and mother. When, for some unknown reason, the Governor Alexander took Cyrica at the age of five from her mother, Cyrica would not be comforted but howled, struggled, and kicked; and, at last, scratched the Governor’s face. Alexander, understandably enraged, threw the child down the stone steps of the Tribune, killing her outright.

And you can call me Harold, like in Harold in Italy, like when I was a poet. ",
