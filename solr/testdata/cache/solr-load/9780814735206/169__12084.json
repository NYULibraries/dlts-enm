Therefore, the awarding of this medal of excellence to the leader of the greatest of Hungary’s churches can be viewed as an expression of appreciation to the leaders of the other two churches as well.\nThe stands adopted by the churches vis-à-vis the Jews were identical. Furthermore, they strongly resembled—if they were not identical with—the position taken by the leaders of the regime regarding the Jews. The official organ of the Catholic church prided itself in that the Hungarian legislator imbibed his ideas from articles appearing in previous editions of the publication. During the debate on the second anti-Jewish act, on April 20, 1939, Magyar Kurir wrote,\nWhile Jewry begs (like a beggar extending his hand) for a sense of brotherhood among the Hungarian public, it is unwilling to bend even a finger in order to return to the Hungarians those positions it, in its impudent and ruthless arrogance, grabbed control of…. The Jewish question has not yet been solved, and its very existence is stifling and poisonous…. Many important legislators have adopted our rulings, even as our minister of law has adopted them in referring often, openly and lengthily, to what we wrote in earlier issues.\nThe Hungarian people were well aware of the position taken by its leaders, and its hatred of the Jews who were identified with international communism grew ever stronger—as did its fear of the Red Army approaching the borders of its country. In the spring of 1944 the banners of that army were flying on the northeastern slopes of the Carpathian mountain range, within sight of the Hungarian border. The triangle—the regime, the church, and the people—stood firm in a united front in its opposition to the Hungarian Jewish population, and this population, in turn, found itself helpless, isolated, shunned, debased, beaten, and robbed—at the focal point of waves of hatred, on the most fateful day in its history of hundreds of years, the day of the German invasion of Hungary, March 19, 1944.    ",
