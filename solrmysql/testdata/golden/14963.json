            "pageText": "fashion, and Jews were increasingly united by a surge of support for Israel as a symbol of determination to survive after the Holocaust, as a necessary means of achieving Jewish autonomy independent of a hostile majority, and as a self-chosen Jewish way of life. While American culture became fascinated with the complex ethnic roots of its heterogeneous population, a concomitant interest in Jewish roots arose. A Jewish community had probably never enjoyed such a positive image as that of American Jewry in the fifties and sixties, nor felt more accepted.\nIn light of post-World War II developments, it has become possible to perceive yet another way in which America stood out in the course of Jewish history: as Jews have become Americanized, they had contributed much to the liberal ideal of Americanism itself. American culture was remarkably absorbent of certain of the ethnic features of the groups that constituted the American populace: in popular culture (foods, humor, music, slang) and in politics and intellectual life (the American labor movement, New Deal and Fair Deal liberalism, racial desegregation, civil liberties, avant-garde arts, new directions in literary criticism), Jews were quite conspicuous. Just as Jews had remade themselves and their religion in light of their ideal of America, so they projected into the American dream Jewish values and yearnings. If American cultural forms were reshaping Jewishness, Jews helped shape America’s conception of itself.\nIn the late sixties, however, there began to appear signals that called into question whether or not Jewish continuity and integration in America had been truly stabilized. Muting of antisemitism and enthusiasm for Israel were countered by fascination with Israel’s purported failings and by disparagements that, to sensitive ears (perhaps hypersensitive, perhaps prescient), seemed close to antisemitism in new dress. Of broader impact on the Jewish situation were the changes becoming increasingly apparent as a result of Jewish acceptance, changes that were rapidly and dramatically remaking most of American Jewry in the absence of a continued stream of immigrants from traditional Old World Jewish backgrounds and upbringings. The decline of social barriers went hand in hand with a weakening of inhibitions against marriage outside the faith. The Jewish birthrate declined and the divorce rate soared. ",
