Public deliberation and public culture: The writings of Bernhard Peters, 1993–2005. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.\nNOTES\n1. Neil Fligstein, in a fascinating interview with the McGill Sociological Review 1 (2010), pp. 59–65, published online at http://www.mcgill.ca/msr/volume1/interview/, speaks to field theory’s ambitions: “I think field theory is a huge breakthrough. It cuts across the social sciences . . . . [sociologist and fellow field theorist] John Levi Martin and I have a standing joke that we’re working on the theory of everything. So we call it the TOE when we’re hanging out together. That is a joke! But I think with field theory, you come back to what do human beings do and how they make collective action happen. . . . how groups of people and groups of groups do these kinds of interactions and watch other people and reference other people and take positions, a very generic level of social process.”\n2. While for reasons of space I focus in this paper on Najjar’s work (2007), Noha Mellor (2007) also makes extensive use of Bourdieu (and Habermas). Unlike Najjar, Mellor is explicit that “Western theories developed to account for changes in Western societies cannot be used uncritically to analyze non-Western societies . . . rather, field theory is meant to serve as a building block” (p. 4). Mellor suggests some interesting modifications to field theory based on characteristics of Arab media and their audiences. For instance, Al Jazeera (and many other Arab media) uses an elevated written variant of Arabic yet its audience is more likely to be composed of low-income/low-education viewers than high-income/high-education viewers. This challenges Bourdieu’s argument that there will tend to be “homologies” between media production and consumption (ibid., 4; see also Benson \u0026 Neveu, 2005 for discussion of the possibility of such variations in the extent of homologies).\n3. See Monge \u0026 Contractor (2003) for a comprehensive review of the social network literature. All of these strains of network theory are increasingly in dialogue with another, as evidenced by an International Network Theory Conference held 19–20 February 2010 by the USC-Annenberg School of Communication featuring presentations by Manuel Castells, Bruno Latour, Noshir Contractor, Peter Monge, Yochai Benkler, and others (see http://ascnetworksnetwork.org/ann-conference for summaries and videos of presentations).\n4. Van Loon (2000, pp. 109–10) offers a similar analysis: “[W]ith the publication of Manuel Castells’s Rise of the Network Society (1996), network-theory became firmly established as a mainstream force in contemporary political economy. However, Castells’s almost uncompromising economism which is seductively intertwined with an ethos of technological determinism, made it difficult for those bending towards more cultural analytical orientations to engage productively with this concept. Instead, refuge was being sought in the more elusive and complex Deleuzoguattarian concept of assemblage. . . . Somewhere between the political-economic notion of ‘network’ and the differentialist notion of ‘assemblage,’ we can find ‘actor networks.’ Actor networks are more dynamic than network structures, but less elusive than assemblages.”\n\n\n\n",
