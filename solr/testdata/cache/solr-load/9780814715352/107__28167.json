Baram also ridiculed a planned demonstration (which never materialized) in support of Bosnia by the “Young Guard” of the Labour Party and the Palestinian Authority.52\nAnd then there is the case of former Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, who in an offhand remark to a Boston Globe reporter revealed much about the prejudices besetting Israeli society. In a discussion of why, in the then mayor’s view, Israel must retain sovereignty over all Jerusalem, he explained, “Deep down in Arab philosophy is the conquest by war and not a peaceful conquest.” Interviewer: “So that if you were to give them East Jerusalem, they’d still declare war? That’s your feeling?” Kollek: “I’m convinced of that. They don’t want East Jerusalem. Look, they still want Granada and Cordoba and half of Spain—it belongs to them. ‘The Dawlet el Islam, the land of Islam that we once ruled, we will rule again.’ You can observe that again about Bosnia. That is basic Islam. I make it difficult for myself [saying this] but I have to see that, too.”53\nWhy Kollek thought he made things difficult for himself is not clear. The remark about Bosnia in particular, at least in the Israeli context, was certainly at the time not terribly out of synch. Indeed, it recalled a familiar dilemma: evil never presents itself naked on the stage of history; it always appears dressed up as itself the victim, the defender, the perhaps misunderstood struggler for survival (as observers of Serbian statements frequently point out). Thus the leaflets of the Black Hundreds never proclaimed: “We are pogromists, and have come to rape, pillage, and murder defenseless Jews.” Rather, they exhorted, “Mother Russia is in peril. The Jews are bringing it to its knees. Come save Mother Russia.” The message was between the lines, but nonetheless clear: Disregard the actual facts on the ground; a Jew is always a Jew and Mother Russia must be defended. Similarly, when the affable cultured (ex-)mayor says, “You can observe that again about Bosnia. That is basic Islam,” he doesn’t mean that you can observe it literally as much as he means, “Disregard the actual facts on the ground. A Muslim is always a Muslim.” One better than Arendt, it is the sheer civility of evil that is squarely beneath our gaze.\nThe Kollek interview was reprinted in the Jerusalem Post editor’s column.54 Editor David Bar-Illan regarded Kollek’s views as deeply insightful; he similarly reprinted for its presumed merits Uri Elitsur’s Yediot Aharonot column which argued, “Maybe the terrible stories of ethnic cleansing, genocide, ",
