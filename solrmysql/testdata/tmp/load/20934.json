She wipes her fingers on her thigh, retrieves the voice.\n“I’d never have guessed it,” Flynn replies, attempting basso profundo. “Long time no see.”\n“And you’re the one I had to talk to anyway. I won’t even ask how anybody else is, I know everybody must be just fine, but I had a dream and this is long distance.”\n“Don’t worry about a thing, mama, I can get it for you wholesale, but I’m busy right now.”\n“I had a dream,” Daisy continued, “about you. Last night, I had it again. And nobody’s been answering the phone. Let me tell you this dream.”\n“How’s married life been treating you, mama?

Thank you, I use it every minute of the day; but I had this dream and let me finish. I dreamed I was making love to you.

And suddenly, in this dream, that little thing that grows at the top of a woman down there, that little bud, turned into two separate little pieces of electrical wire—two little gold electric things. And in this dream I was supposed to somehow connect the two wires together. The little bud was gone, you get it? And these two wires … I was supposed to connect them and fit you back ",
