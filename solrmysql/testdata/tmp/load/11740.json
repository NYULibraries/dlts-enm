The first revolves around the statement in the same baraita that we have seen before that Qohelet, together with Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Isaiah, was written by Hezekiah and his colleagues. This implies that the rabbis considered the contents to be Solomonic but not the actual written form, which was established by Hezekiah and his colleagues. Thus, we see that the rabbis did not attribute the composition of this book to Solomon, but, at most, he was viewed as the originator of the thoughts contained therein. Now it is impossible that the words of Solomon (d. 920 B.C.E.) could have survived all those generations in oral form until Hezekiah (late eighth century) finally wrote them down. Presumably, the rabbis also realized this, and thus it seems that Krochmal wants to say that the rabbis did not regard this as part of the Solomonic corpus at all.33 In implausibly attributing the book to Hezekiah, the rabbis were furtively indicating that they knew full well that Qohelet was not of Solomonic origins. As to why they would have chosen this particular attribution when they knew that the book was in fact far later than Hezekiah, we must accept on faith that they had their reasons in concealing from the masses the truth regarding Qohelet.\nThe second rabbinic passage that Krochmal considers in this connection is one from Qohelet Rabbah (1:12), in which the rabbis interpret the corresponding verse to mean that the book was written by Solomon after he had abdicated his throne. Yet, all the references to Solomonâ€™s career agree that he reigned until his death, and thus this view could hardly ",
