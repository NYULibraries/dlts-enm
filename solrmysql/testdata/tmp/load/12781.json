            "pageText": "wasteland, unexploded arsenal, littered terrain, the “third world.” The question that Nietzsche presses us on is therefore never merely one of affirming homelessness after metaphysics, but of rendering spaces habitable, multiplying trajectories for life and the living, refiguring the site of experimentation in such a way as to ensure that it is not already the ensepulchered reserve of the living dead. In other words: why have we not yet thought the test site on the side of life? It is important to note that Nietzsche is not, in this phase of this thought, the exhuberant adolescent of old. The Nietzsche who thinks the experiment has come back from the dead several times over; he is formulating his theory of the great health; he has returned once again to health and, like a great convalescent, looks at life with a somewhat ghostly air that dissolves only gradually. Still, he is on the move again, and homelessness becomes an expression of renewed vitality, the overcoming of passive destitution. The homelessness that Nietzsche posits is never simply reactive, therefore, but defiant and future-oriented. Resembling at moments the crew of Star Trek, “we who are homeless are too manifold and mixed racially. … We are not tempted to participate in mendacious self-admiration and racial indecency” (340). Racial indecency is, Nietzsche suggests everywhere, the absence of test. It is the untested presumption and would never hold scientific sway. Racial indecency and self-admiration go steadily together, for one not only feeds the other but refuses the movement of self-overcoming, which is to say, ceaseless self-correction. Nietzsche, however, is by no means setting up a political correctional facility, with human subjects weighted down by punishing chains. To be capable of a long distance will to knowledge one must consistently lighten up. Also: “One has to be very light to drive one’s will to knowledge into such a distance and beyond one’s time … The human being of such a beyond undergoes a test of strength” (343).\nA mark of the beyond, or of sending and envoi, the test site is an articulation of being-not-at-home, whether this be figured as the desert of nuclear testing, a constellation of the underground, in the lab or, as Nietzsche has it, very happily far away—at a remove from the fatherland, in Italy, where experimental life can be affirmed. What does Nietzsche say about the age of the experiment?\n",
