Past experience is important because it can and does provide a judgment framework that fits current circumstances. In times of consensual disarray, judgment is, if anything, even more critical. In these circumstances the president is required to extrapolate from a past that, by definition, will not fit the present.\nMoreover, it takes more self-confidence to be president in times of disarray than in times of consensus. Yet even in times of disarray, a president’s self-confidence is better if it is tempered by a degree of realistic humility than if it is grandiose. The view “I think I can, and I will try” reflects a different characterological calculus than the view “There’s no doubt I can, and I will.” The latter may accurately reflect the candidate’s view of himself but does an injustice to public. The disarray of consensus reflects a view among many that the old ways (whatever they were) are not working, yet what might take their place is unclear. In such circumstances, people seek reassurance, and it is tempting for candidates to inspire faith rather than realistic hope. The former rests on a somewhat unsubstantiated expectation of results, the latter on their possibility rather than their likelihood.\nConclusion\nThe concern with issues of psychological suitability and presidential character in American politics is likely to remain controversial. It should be kept in mind, however, that public and professional concern with these issues takes place within a context of the democratic selection of political leadership. For most political systems, in most historical periods, information about emotional stability, character, or the leadership ability of persons contending for power, even if available, would be irrelevant. Where political leaders are not freely chosen by citizens, it makes little sense to discuss these issues.\nThe question of whether this kind of analysis should be attempted seems moot at this point. Analyses of character and its relationship to presidential performance already are an important part of presidential campaigns and seem unlikely to disappear, as long as the discretionary nature of presidential power remains. The question is whether a responsible, useful, and solid ",
