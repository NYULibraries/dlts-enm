            "pageText": "Surely Chuang-tzu would approve of this inability to categorize and judge and find in it something of nature’s richness of opposites, unpremeditated shifting, and freeing of alternatives.\nIt is true that Montaigne speaks in a strange amalgam of quotations, generalizations, and confessions, a little like a ventriloquist who wants desperately to be confidential but can no longer speak except through the mouths of his dummies. But he travels along his trail like a meandering dog, sniffing here and there and getting only to where it turns out he wants to go after he gets there. He sees philosophy not as rigorous intellectualism but as either wisdom, for which he has great respect, or adulterated or irregular poetry, for which he does not. He likes middling things best, but not abstention from excitement, because our lives are harmonies composed of contraries, sweet and biting, high and low, light and heavy; and he says, to cap and end his essays, that “it is an absolute perfection and virtually divine to know how to enjoy our being rightfully” and seek no other condition but that in which we are (Frame 1958, 857).\nChuang-tzu’s talk is penetrating, fantastic, forcefully irregular poetry, and Montaigne’s essays are spillover saying. The incomparable Derrida glories in showing, in Chuang-tzu’s language, that “alternatives proceed,” that we shift from one meaning or position to another, and that our books and systems are not in fact consistent and that “their formation,” as Chuang-tzu would say, “is a dissolution” (Graham 1981, 53). Writing, as Derrida describes, “by ellipses, corrections and corrections of corrections, letting go of each concept at the very moment when I needed to use it” (Derrida 1976, xviii), he ends with a text arcane enough to make a commentator almost as useful as for the text of Chuang-tzu. It makes the impression that Derrida’s self-imposed mission, to uncover disintegrative secrets in the writings of others, has decided him to hide his own secrets behind a barrier of oblique observations.\nThis critical remark may be unfair to Derrida’s attempt to say what can at most be hinted at. One of his sources is Nietzsche, who argues quite directly, while Derrida believes that in principle he must argue indirectly. Let me illustrate the difference between the two. Nietzsche says, directly, that logic falsifies because, in using ",
