Human physiology is constitutively local and translocal in these depictions of the man, multiplied by the number of diseases and distributed across the assembled universe. Biological and astrological bodies belong to a larger totality, which is another way of saying that they are not totally themselves. They are virtually elsewhere (celestial) even while inhabiting someplace (terrestrial) (see Plate 2).\n        Cosmology casts a wide net, and more must be said about the context in which beings—small and large again—are brought into contact with one another in terms that we will recognize as embryological and epigenetic. On one hand, everything seems to be in its proper place, proportionate, harmonious, and hierarchical. There is no shortage of apologists (past and present) for the dominant but now discarded image of the universe that has origins in the ancient description of a tidily structured system of mainly concentric spheres. A fourteenth-century English poet offers a neat summation: in the seventh book of his Confessio Amantis, Gower explains that the four elements, the complexions, the seven planets, the fixed stars all move around a stationary center. The human occupies pride of place in the constellation. Macrobius’s Commentary on the Dream of Scipio was one influential source of Gower’s idea: as the former teaches, the soul rules the body just as God rules the universe, which is why “philosophers called the universe a huge man and man a miniature universe.”196 As Gower says, “a man in special / The lasse world is properly.” He is a “litel world” around whom everything pivots.197 The universe is also sometimes conceived as fully optimized. Boethius’s famous hymn to a divine “love which rules the earth and the seas, and commands the heavens,” set a precedent.198 A passage in Bartholomaeus seems equally emphatic, referring to a world made “in a certein acorde and proporcioun of armeny [harmony],” with the heavens rotating around the earth, producing “melody,” all of which is mirrored in the harmony of the internal organs and limbs of the human body.199 In this context, the microcosm and macrocosm seem well attuned.\n        Granted, ancient cosmology often aspires to a recognizable holism, economy, and autarchy, but equilibrium was an optimistic ideal asserted against so much that was known to exist (and exist unknown) in the same universe, and against a profound sense of the humiliating small",
