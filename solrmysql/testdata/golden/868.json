They had begun to see themselves as ambassadors for the region. Some also expressed a desire to engage in community service in their home communities.\nThe college student counselors also developed personally and professionally. Some indicated that they had developed a greater understanding of youth, the challenges they face, and the ways in which they deal with these challenges. Half said they had a greater awareness of young people's resiliency and how they cope with trauma and disruption. They also learned how to develop strong relationships with youth.

Almost 90 percent of the counselors rated developing relationships with their fellow counselors as a great outcome, and more than 94 percent said they found the relationships they had developed with the youth to be outstanding. Clearly, the strongest impact in the camp experience was the relationships developed between the campers and their counselors.
