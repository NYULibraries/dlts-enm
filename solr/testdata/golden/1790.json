These stipulations reveal that the IOC considers the Games to be its core property, not that of the host city, which is borrowing the association. This indicates aspects of a division in directing the narrative—between the IOC, which is setting the conditions of the stage, and the host city, which is facilitating its orchestration. The Olympic Charter offers further details. Specifically, Rule 53 notes that\n… 2 No form of advertising or other publicity shall be allowed in and above the stadia, venues and other competition areas which are considered as part of the Olympic sites. …\n3 No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas. (IOC 2004, 101)\nThe effects of such guidelines are clearly visible in the stadia, where spectators, athletes, and officials are prohibited from doing or wearing anything that might act contrary to this rule. Furthermore, areas of IOC regulation continue to expand. For instance, during recent Olympics, all billboard space within the city center and areas surrounding the Olympic venues was offered to Olympic sponsors or else left empty to avoid ambush marketing. In this sense, the entire city is construed as and becomes an “Olympic site.”\nTo understand the full implications of this situation, it is important to note the nature of delivery structures within the Olympic Games. The city authorities are in charge of establishing an Organizing Committee that will deliver the Games according to IOC regulations, but with funding and support from local, regional, and national government agencies. The IOC delimits what is “owned” by the Olympic Movement—thus granting privileged access to members of the Olympic Family—during the period of the Games. Yet, local authorities have also attempted to protect ownership of other spaces that may use the Games as a platform to promote activities other than the official Olympic program and parts of the Olympic program not set as priority by the IOC. The latter include the Cultural Olympiad6 and education activities, which tend to focus on the representation of local and national identities. The establishment of Nonaccredited Media Centers could be described as one of the most paradigmatic examples of such attempts at protecting ownership by the local hosts of platforms outside the obligations of the Host City Contract and IOC regulations.\n",
