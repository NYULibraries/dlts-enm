On this point, Mayhew obviously departed from the Protestant mainstream.115\nIn addition to its consequences for American Protestantism and political thought, the Great Awakening acted as a type of social cement. Although the revivalists tended to splinter American Protestantism into multiple denominations, the Great Awakening ultimately was “a great unifying force that gave to ‘four-fifths’ of the Christians in America ‘a common understanding of the Christian life and the Christian faith.’”116 Despite the theological disagreements among revivalists, the evangelical movement helped begin to forge a national consciousness across the boundaries of the various colonies—a national consciousness that would become crucial to the American Revolution. The later colonies, then, were marked by a unified and vigorous commitment to Protestantism, as manifested in a plurality of Protestant denominations. For the most part, the overriding goal for eighteenth-century colonial Americans strikingly resembled that of the early Puritans: to create and maintain “a Christian civilization.”117\nBecause late colonial America was thoroughly Protestant in religion and culture, the colonists predictably displayed a high degree of antisemitism, though still largely against the conceptual Jew (since so few Jews were actually present). Dogmatic antisemitism was especially rampant among the Great Awakening revivalists. For example, Gilbert Tennent attacked unconverted ministers who supposedly resembled “the Old Pharisee-Teachers,” who were “very proud and conceity” and “crafty as Foxes; they tried by all Means to ensnare our Lord by their captious Questions.”118 Joseph Bellamy, a student of Jonathan Edwards, condemned “the Jewish nation [for having] murdered God’s own Son.” In arguing that despite predestination Christian individuals are to blame for sin and bad temper, Bellamy reasoned that “[y]ou have as much power to help being of such a temper as the Scribes and Pharisees had; but Christ judged them to be wholly to blame, and altogether inexcusable.”119 Jonathan Edwards himself wrote:\n\nAs to the Jews … the generality of them rejected Christ and his gospel, with extreme pertinaciousness of spirit. They not only went on still in that career of corruption, which had been increasing from the time of the Maccabees; but Christ’s coming, and his doctrine and miracles, and the preaching of his followers, and the glorious things that attended the same, were the occasion, through their perverse improvement, of an infinite increase of their wickedness. They crucified the Lord of Glory, with the utmost malice and cruelty, and persecuted his followers; they pleased not God, and were contrary to all men; and went on to grow worse and worse, till they filled up the measure ",
