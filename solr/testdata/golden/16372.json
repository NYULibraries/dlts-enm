The so-called mature ego has renounced the pleasure principle and has substituted for it the reality principle. It does not follow the direct path of instinctual gratification, without regard to consequences, to the demands of reality, does not indulge in hallucinatory wish fulfillment, but tests external reality . . . adapting its thoughts and actions to the demands of reality. This conception of the relationship between ego and reality presupposes a fundamental antagonism that has to be bridged or overcome in order to make life in this reality possible. (1980, 3)\n\nTwo years after he delivered “Ego and Reality,” Loewald returned to this theme again in “The Problem of Defense and the Neurotic Interpretation of Reality.”\n\nThe relationship between organism and environment, between individual and reality, in general has been understood in psychoanalytic theory as basically antagonistic. It is Freud’s “biological assumption” that a stimulus is something hostile to the organism and to the nervous system. Ultimately, instinct itself is understood as a need or compulsion to abolish stimuli. Any stimulus, as stimulus, represents a threat, a disturbance. On the psychological level, Freud comes to the conclusion that at the stage of the original reality ego, “at the very beginning, it seems, the external world, objects, and what is hated are identical.” (1980, 28)\n\nYet, what is this “reality” that poses such a threat to us? Is this a reality of our own making, as Freud hypothesized so enigmatically as “psychical reality”, ",
