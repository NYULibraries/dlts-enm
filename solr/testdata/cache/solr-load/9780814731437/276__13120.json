She was gracious enough to pinpoint exactly what I could do to conform with her Platonic form of a work in legal history: “One [presumably, she] hopes that he will write another, less idiosyncratic account of the motivations and fate of Chase the Antifederalist-cum-Federalist jurist, situate himself firmly within relevant literatures, and, as they say in Reno, let the chips (read ‘policy implications’) fall where they may.”46\nOne [I] suspects that it is this “policy implications” problem that really disturbs VanBurkleo, and I think she could speak for many members of her generation of legal historians. Still, her other points need some rebuttal before we reach this question. VanBurkleo bemoaned its “idiosyncratic approach”—neither a comprehensive history of the courts at the time nor a full judicial biography, nor a treatise on all aspects of early constitutional law. The writing of history, or any other form of scholarship, it seems to me, benefits from divergent approaches (isn’t that the theoretical justification of “diversity” as an academic goal, after all?), and if we seek to remove idiosyncrasy we’ll be the poorer for it. Who wants a bunch of conformists re-spouting each generation’s conventional wisdom? Isn’t the power of some of the greatest recent works in American legal history the strong individual voices of their respective authors? (One thinks here of Morton Horwitz’s Bancroft Prize-winning Transformation of American Law, 1776-1860 [1977].)47\nBut I digress. VanBurkleo’s objection to my idiosyncrasy is firmly grounded in two other problems. First, she argued that in my work on Chase, I had failed to situate myself “firmly within the relevant literatures.” Apparently unaware that others, such as Kent Newmyer, had concluded exactly the opposite on this point,48 VanBurkleo declared that the dichotomous approach I had employed was wrong, and that I would have done better to use the same Kent Newmyer’s approach of a “matrix or set of ideological choices.” Instead of trying to situate ",
