While the president is the single person in charge of this singularly critical institution in the American political system, he is never alone. Everywhere the president turns, there are people. There are people whose sole responsibility is to ensure that he is taken care of, protected, informed, appraised, advised, bolstered, kept on track, reminded of deadlines; to speak for him; to find out for him; to do what he can’t do and, sometimes, what he shouldn’t. The president’s world is filled as much with people as it is with policy.\nHis relationships with Congress, with the press, with the public, with his own party and with the opposition, and with those who support and those who oppose him abroad—these and many more relationships that could be noted—all reflect the profoundly intense relational nature of the presidency. It is not only that this one man is at the center of this Archimedean institution but that his feelings and ways of dealing with all these relationships are also. It is a fact so obvious that its significance has not been fully appreciated.\nPolitical scientists are used to dealing with the president’s relationships with others in terms of a series of external concentric circles. At the center is the president, in the first outer ring are his most intimate and trusted advisers, and so on. However, there is another way to approach the relational presidency, and that is to examine the function of others in the president’s inner psychology. Here, too, we deal with a series of concentric circles measured by a proximity—distance radius, with the important difference that they are internal rather than external and organized according to their psychological meaning and significance to the person.\nEvents, things, and especially people that have special emotional valence for the candidate or president are part of his internal world. In clinical theory, the study of these internal images—how they got there and what they mean—is the study of “object relations.”5 Among the important dimensions of this internal world of objects is whether a particular internal object is “good”—that is, whether it provides available memories and images of warmth, support, firm and loving care, and so forth—or “bad”—providing the opposite. A person can rigidly categorize particular objects on either basis (sometimes this is appropriate) or see the object as having qualities of both.6\nThe individual’s internal representational world serves psychological functions.7 “Bad” objects are constant reminders of what might (or perhaps is likely to) befall the person if he doesn’t take appropriate steps.
