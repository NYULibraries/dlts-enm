            "pageText": "the rate of change in this measure from 1961 through 1970. In 1961, the growth in the monetary base was 1.7 percent over the previous year. In 1962, it was 3.0 percent. 1963, 1964, and 1965 show respective rates of growth of 4.2, 5.0, and 5.3 percent.\nThe significance of the increase in the rate of growth in the monetary base lies in its impact on prices in the economy. Other things equal, a 1 percent increase in the monetary base is associated with a 1 percent increase in the implicit price deflator for GNP.22 If nothing else had changed, the escalation in the monetary base would have produced a price explosion. However, other things did not remain the same. Largely as a result of increases in labor productivity that averaged 3.7 percent a year for 1962–65, the real output of goods and services was growing rapidly. And, again, other things equal, every percentage point of growth in real GNP tends to reduce the rate of growth in the GNP deflator by 0.6 percentage points.23 Since the average rate of growth in real GNP for 1962–65 was 5.8 percent, the rate of growth in the deflator was held to an average of 1.5 percent a year. However, by 1965, it had climbed to 2.3 percent.\nThe 1962–65 interval is characterized by a subtle form of “money illusion” in labor markets. Ordinarily, we think of money illusion as occurring when money wage rates do not move along with variations in the price level. However, it also may be present when money wage rate changes do not accurately reflect movements in the average productivity of labor. In general, the money wage rate adjustment mechanism captures productivity changes in only a partial fashion in the short run. As we have already pointed out, labor productivity increased at an average of 3.7 percent a year and the implicit price deflator by 1.5 percent a year. Money wage rates, though, rose by only 4.4 percent a year, 0.8 percentage points less than the sum of the increments in prices and productivity. Table 10.3 provides details of these movements for the years in question.\nThe failure of money wage rates to advance as rapidly as prices and productivity in combination produced a significant fall in the adjusted real wage rate. It stood at 100.8 (1977 = 100) in 1961 but had declined to 97.4 by 1965. Accompanying this drop was a downward movement in the unemployment rate to 4.5 percent. Not surprisingly, a further fall in unemployment, to 3.8 percent, occurred in 1966. The secret of beating down the unemployment rate to below 4 percent by the mid-1960s lay in workers’ real wage rates not advancing as rapidly as the average productivity of labor. In the process, the corporate profit share of national income increased from 11.7 to 13.5 percent between 1961 and 1966.24 As business profits rose, employment expanded and unemployment fell.\nIn a world of lagged labor-market adjustments, money illusion is a temporary phenomenon. After 1965, the rate of change in money wage rates began to escalate. Over the next four years, it would average 6.8 percent. Combined with a slowing in the average rate of growth in labor productivity to 2.2 percent a year, this should have led to a significant rise in the adjusted real wage rate. This did not occur until 1969, however. The inflationary pressure implicit in the higher rates of growth in the monetary base now began to surface and the average rate of increase in the GNP deflator was 3.7 percent, with a peak of 4.8 percent in 1969. Again, detailed movements in the pertinent statistics are provided for the individual years in table 10.3.\n",
