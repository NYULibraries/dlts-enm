            "pageText": "many Birch teachers made a point of actually teaching these skills and explaining when and why students would need to know the information.\n      This practice is not unlike Lisa Delpit’s suggestion that teachers must expose low-income students and students of color to the “culture of power” in order to truly provide a high-quality education (Delpit 1988, 1995). She explains that this culture of power includes the rules and norms (i.e., the “codes”) that reflect the dominant group, and that if you are not already a member of this group, being told explicitly about the codes will make acquiring power easier. In other words, efforts by Birch teachers to explicitly convey information about academic expectations, norms, and rules facilitated the acquisition of greater school success and potentially increased access to power among their minoritized student body. This type of training is important and admirable work, but it also buys into the myth of meritocracy and fails to challenge the structural imbalance of resources and rules that frame schooling.\n      Many Birch teachers did not assume equal opportunity existed. Rather, they knew their students started out academically behind their east-side peers, and they knew their students faced additional obstacles as they moved through the school system. This is an important difference from the powerblind, colorblind formal equality operating at Spruce. In many instances, Birch teachers exhibited a more race-conscious and power-conscious allegiance to equality. They recognized unequal playing fields, and they believed that a pointed academic focus would result in a more level playing field. But they also still operated under the belief that once the field was made level, meritocracy would be fairly applied and equality would thus be achieved.\n      In some ways, then, Birch was pushing the boundaries of the niceness exhibited in Spruce’s reliance on powerblind, colorblind formal equality. Acknowledging inequality and talking to students about specific strategies for succeeding in the face of disparities is like treading on the outskirts of potentially choppy water. But any allegiance to formal equality maintains some degree of niceness. Here even Birch educators kept a safe distance from the waters of inequity by not specifically and explicitly addressing the structural impossibility of equality given patterned and systemic inequity.\n      Although it was more race conscious and power conscious, the restrictive formal equality framework driving Birch’s focus on academics and reading provides a poignant illustration of how Birch is educated in and educating for whiteness. What could be wrong with emphasizing academic success and literacy? Indeed, such an emphasis is what has for decades been missing from schools serving primarily low-income families and youth of color. It is a risky venture to go down the path of ",
