Raymond, Republican of New York, insisted that emancipation could only be the beginning: “Having gone this far, I desire to go on by successive steps still farther, and to elevate them in all respects, so far as their faculties will allow and our power will permit us to do, to an equality with the other persons and races in this country.”\nAgain, Johnson vetoed. Again, his vision of meritocracy provided the rationale:\n\nThe white race and the black race of the South have hitherto lived together under the relation of master and slave—capital owning labor. Now, suddenly, that relation is changed, and as to the ownership, capital and labor are divorced. They stand now each master of itself. In this new relationship, one being necessary to the other, there will be a new adjustment, which both are deeply interested in making harmonious. Each has equal power in settling the terms, and if left to the laws that regulate capital and labor, it is confidently believed that they will satisfactorily work out the problem. Capital, it is true, has more intelligence; but labor is never so ignorant as not to understand its own interests, not to know its own value, and not to see that capital must pay that value. This bill frustrates this adjustment.\n\nOn April 6 the Senate voted to override 33 to 15; the next day, the House voted to override 122 to 41. It was the first time in American history that Congress enacted a major piece of legislation over the president’s veto.\nAnd so it went. For each new measure, equality’s friends insisted that intervention was needed to provide a true equality of opportunity to the freedman; only then could he succeed—or, as many claimed, fail—on his merits. And for each new measure, equality’s opponents insisted that there had been too much intervention already; nature had already decreed the black man’s status, and she should now run her inevitable course.\n",
