            "pageText": "thing strange about them. In these areas custom wins out over efficiency, and business is conducted in an opaque and ambiguous manner that international society finds incomprehensible. The rules of competition and all the other principles of modern economic theory simply do not apply.\nUnder the Staple Food Control Act, for instance, rice cannot be imported into Japan. This law serves both to protect Japanese farmers and to allow Japan to remain self-sufficient in its staple food (see chapter 4), but it also means that the Japanese consumer has to pay several times the world price for rice. A similar situation holds true with regard to the distribution network. Although European goods, for example, are sold at reasonable prices in the American marketplace, as soon as they enter Japan’s domestic market, they wind their way through mysterious channels and emerge bearing higher price tags than can be found anywhere else in the world. This is true of Burberry, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and all the rest. Someone somewhere seems to be making an exorbitant profit, but who?\nA country’s logical and illogical policies are what I like to think of as its “front door” versus its “back door.” If Japan’s logical trade policies are viewed as a front door, then its illogical domestic policies are its back door. Japan has kept its main entrance neat and clean for all to see, but its back door is a mess. When the United States finally became aware of this, it began complaining that Japan’s dirty domestic policies block America’s access to Japanese markets. Its demands for a back door that would give America easier access was what the 1989-90 U.S.–Japan Structural Impediments Initiative talks were all about.\n",
