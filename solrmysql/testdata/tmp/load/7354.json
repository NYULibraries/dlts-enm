On Occupy, Benjamin, a 22-year-old college student, recalled, “I went to some of their big marches. It was very fun. It was very exhilarating to see lots of people very angry about injustices and issues that I thought are completely justified to be angry about.” Twenty-five-old Charles added:\nPersonally, I am very sympathetic [to the OWS movement]. They are equally upset with the status quo as we are, and we identify a lot of the same problems like government being involved with various corporations—very bad.

The HPA, for example, has partnered with established nonprofits such as Oxfam, Partners in Health, and STAND on many of its campaigns. These partnerships enabled the HPA to connect its volunteers’ monetary donations as well as their time and effort with the on-the-ground experience and networks of these nonprofits.
