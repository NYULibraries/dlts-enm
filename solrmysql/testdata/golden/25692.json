Is the citizen of such a state ipso facto a member of the Jewish people? Should such a state be structured in keeping with the laws of Torah, or the principles of Torah, or the concepts of liberal democracy, the hokhmah of our time? Will the equality of the get, affirmed thirty-six times in the Torah, apply to all the non-Jews in a Jewish state? Is a Jewish state conceivable that is not democratic? Shall Israel follow the model of western democracies, separating religion from government, or the model of an “Islamic state,” a la Ayatollah Khomeini?\nManifestly, the character of Halachah in Judaism will be powerfully affected by the extent of its involvement with the government of Israel. Laws of religion and of government are different in essence. To make governmental privileges dependent on the practice of religious rituals and on the kashrut of those who administer them is a horrendous requirement in a western society. We cannot tell how Israel will develop in the future. So much depends upon whether a large Arab minority, consisting of the residents of the West Bank and Gaza as well as Israel proper, is embraced within the boundaries of the state. With a non-Jewish minority of nearly 40%, a new constitution may evolve, definitely separating religion from government. Also, spiritual forces emerging from grass-roots Israeli life may well lead to an acceptance of religious pluralism.\nHalachah as religious law can be perverted into secular law, but, ideally, the two domains must be kept apart. For secular law takes no account of intention or relegates it to the background, while, in religion, the demands of spirit and piety are all important. In any case, the import and orientation of the K’lal Yisroel ideal is certain to be affected by developments in Israel, which cannot now be foreseen.\nThe negative implication of K’lal Yisroel is the refusal to read out of Jewish life those who differ from the majority in their interpretation of Judaism. A blurring of the lines of ideology within the Jewish community is the inevitable consequence of such a policy. There may not even be complete consistency within the Conservative movement, because of the need to reconcile the imperatives of progress with reverence for unity.\nA case in point is the enfranchisement of women within congregational life. The first step was to institute Bat Mizvah observances as part of the Sabbath services. The next step was to grant aliyot and other ",
