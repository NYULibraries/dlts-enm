Indeed, such a conclusion is consistent with a number of Stone’s other films (Salvador, 1986; Platoon, 1986; and Wall Street, 1987) in which the naive central character undergoes a personal transformation resulting in a form of inclusion back into “the world.”\nBeyond the field of popular film the cultural emphasis on healing the veteran’s wound through a form of cultural integration was evident in legal attempts to specify the wounding effects suffered by Vietnam veterans exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange. The veterans’ Agent Orange case stressed the need for compensation as the outcome of the legal process. Compensation refers to making amends for something missing or removed. The object of compensation, then, is to restore a subject to wholeness. Similarly, medical science is predicated on the presumption that it can perform restorative work on the body. The two patterns, financial compensation and medical restitution, interrelated in legal moves within the Agent Orange case to seek a solution to issues of bodily health. The Dow Chemical Company, one manufacturer of the defoliants used in Vietnam, argued that the chemical was benign and as such it was not the cause of any of the health problems befalling Vietnam veterans.115 Throughout the early eighties the object of the class action case brought by veterans against a number of companies responsible for manufacturing the herbicide was to arrive at a legal definition and ruling—and in this way, a diagnosis—that would identify the cause of the veterans’ wound. In turn, the (legal) “diagnosis” would function as the starting point for determining levels of compensation for afflicted veterans. The out-of-court settlement by the defendant companies precluded such a court-based diagnosis, thus denying veterans a formal acknowledgment of their wounds.116 In this case the veterans’ wound proved excessive, in the sense that it resisted legal and political moves to establish a definition that would lead to redress for the wound. Elsewhere in the culture, however, formal processes of medical definition and diagnosis provided the basis for the healing of the veterans’ (mental) wound.\nIn 1980, the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders redefined the veteran’s psychological wound as “post-traumatic stress disorder” (PTSD).117 With this diagnosis the wounded Vietnam veterans were no longer outsiders marginalized by authority—they were, instead, the focus of incorporation through the healing aegis of authority. PTSD identified the symptoms to be treated for the full recuperation of the veteran and provided ",
