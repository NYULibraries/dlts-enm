Her people (in this instance, not just women), however, are unable to “restrain themselves from talking to her on what they well knew she would fain be silent,” forcing her to leave them.133 The determination of the Algonquin woman not to reveal her husband’s secret sets her apart from the others described above as capitulating to group pressure. But no less than they does she experience a push-pull situation, conflicted as she is by her desire for independence from as well as attachment to her culture. Perhaps the cosmic significance of her marriage to a nature deity suggests that she has already detached herself sufficiently from the mundane world to resist its coercion.\nEqually afraid of the group that pushes her toward or pulls her away from her mate, Psyche frequently finds her entrance into marriage terrifying. A Romanian gypsy princess agrees to marry a snake because she is “afraid to say no,”134 and in a similar story from modern Hungary, it is not clear whether the bride’s shrieks when left alone with her serpent husband express terror or loathing. Only gradually does her outrage give way to her acceptance of the snake into her bed.135 In an Armenian-American story, the serpent groom who could allay his wife’s distaste as she passively submits to his embrace declines to do so: “The snake insisted on sleeping with his wife. He would lick her face until she was unconscious and fell asleep. When he was certain she was asleep, he would get out of bed, take off his snake skin and put it under the pillow.”136 In contrast, a Polynesian woman is allowed to get used to the unpleasant touch of an eel: “This occurred again and again,” until she became accustomed to the eel, after which its form changed to that of a handsome youth.137 A male narrator from Kentucky deems a bride on the whole fortunate because her frog husband performs the household tasks, but nonetheless sympathizes with her having in her bed “his warty old skin and his toad-frog eyes. Living with a man-sized toad-frog would give a girl the creeps, it seems to me.”138 The bride of the Cossack ",
