            "pageText": "A comparison of the holding in Michael M. with those in Geduldig and Gilbert indicates how the Court treats biology and gender. The fact of potential pregnancy is biological, but the Court makes distinctly social choices about when and whether to give that fact social importance. To vest pregnancy with significance for purposes of a criminal responsibility statute (when that was never the statute’s intended purpose) and yet not consider pregnancy significant when it affects the work life and health of the mother seems wrongheaded in the extreme.\nOne danger of giving biological categories great weight is that it diverts the Court from considering the social explanations for the construction of the categories and excuses the Court from taking into account the cultural ramifications of its decisions. Consider what remains unexplored when the Court focuses on biological facts. In Michael M., the Court’s ready acceptance of potential pregnancy as a justification for the classifications in the statutory rape law masked the legislature’s true intent in constructing those classifications. Left unexamined was the cultural construction of what it means to be male and female. And embedded in that social construct were ideas about male sexual aggression, female vulnerability, and the assumption on the state’s part of a need, as Brennan expressed, “to protect the State’s young females from their own uninformed decisionmaking.”20\nThe same mistake occurred in Geduldig and Gilbert, with the Court’s construction of what are essentially biological—albeit manufactured—categories to resolve the case. The artifice of the distinction between pregnant and nonpregnant persons is transparent. Although the “nonpregnant persons” category includes men and women, the “pregnant persons” category is composed exclusively of women. Once again for the Court, biology dictated the outcome. It was not the physical and social consequences of pregnancy that the Court considered important, but the fact that women (as a biological class) appear in both the “pregnant persons” and “nonpregnant persons” categories. Given the Court’s resolution of the case with the biological syllogism, what lay unexplored? The Court’s refusal to recognize that pregnancy is a disability deserving accommodation “reinforces cultural stereo-types that pregnancy is a ‘natural’ status for women, unlike injuries or diseases designated as disabling, and presumes that women will have no need of financial support should pregnancy render them incapable of working.”21\nThe biological category is also lacking in integrity and stability. Biology is not the reliable empirical hallmark of gender differences that the Court seems to seek. While “potentially pregnant persons” and women constituted ",
