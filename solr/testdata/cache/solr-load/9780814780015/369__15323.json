Dresner, introduction to The Circle of the Baal Shem Tov: Studies in Hasidism, by Abraham Joshua Heschel, ed. and trans. Samuel H. Dresner (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1985). See also Hillel Goldberg, Between Berlin and Slobodka: Jewish Transition Figures from Eastern Europe (Hoboken, N.J.: Ktav, 1989).\n4. In this regard, I agree with Jacob Neusner that American Jewish institutions tend to validate themselves in relation to Israel or to the Holocaust—to the exclusion of knowledge of the multifarious Jewish worlds before World War II, and to the exclusion of religious imperatives. See Jacob Neusner, Strangers at Home: “The Holocaust,” Zionism, and American Judaism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981); also Jacob Neusner, American Judaism: Adventure in Modernity (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1972).\n5.

The printed cover of Das prophetische Bewusstsein carries this information but not the other version, which is entitled Die Prophetie; both were published in 1936 by the Polish Academy of Sciences (Krakow) and Erich Reiss Verlag (Berlin).\n7. Heschel’s poem was first published in the New York Yiddish periodical Zukunft in 1929.\n8. See Ernst Simon, “Jewish Adult Education in Nazi Germany as Spiritual Resistance,” Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook 1 (1956): 68–104, for a study of the phenomenon.\n9.

It would have been misunderstood, in Western Europe, if he had signed his full Hasidic name, Abraham Joshua Heschel Heschel—or with the abridgment that became famous in the United States. (His three given names commemorate his great-great-grandfather, the Apter Rebbe, Abraham Joshua Heschel [1748–1825], known as the Ohev Yisrael, the Lover of Jews.) Neil Rosenstein, ed., The Unbroken Chain, 2 vols. (New York; CIS, 1990) is the basic reference work.\n11. Interview with Fritz A. Rothschild. Later Heschel would help Rothschild, a penniless immigrant, enter the Jewish Theological Seminary, and Rothschild, after joining the faculty, would publish an anthology of Heschel’s writings, Between God and Man: An Interpretation of Judaism (New York: Free Press, 1959; most recent revision of bibliography, ",
