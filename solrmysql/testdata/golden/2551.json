The 1984 act created determinate, mandatory minimum sentences (which took discretionary power from judges and put it in the hands of prosecutors), established a sentencing commission “to devise strict sentencing guidelines,” eliminated federal parole, and “expanded the government's ability to seize property and cash from convicted, or even accused drug dealers, in civil or criminal court.” What was seized went to the police who had done the seizing, which enhanced their eagerness to “collaborate with federal agencies and try drug cases in federal court.”24 The 1986 act added twenty-nine new mandatory minimum sentences. One of these was the notorious five-year mandatory minimum for five grams of crack cocaine or 500 grams of powder cocaine, a law that targeted African Americans, the primary users of crack, and, Parenti says, “translated into apartheid sentencing.”25 Judges were given power to deny probation or suspended sentences to those convicted under the new laws.\nBy 1987, the sentencing commission guidelines were in place, “carrying,” Mauer says, “a heavy presumption of imprisonment for most offenders and little regard for any mitigating circumstances.”26 “Thus began in earnest,” Parenti remarks “the one-sided race war of the late eighties and nineties…open season on ‘social dynamite' and ‘social junk'…open season on urban addicts, economically discarded youth, and petty dealers…the beginning of a nationwide wave of raids and ghettos sweeps,” like New York City's Operation Pressure Point and the “notorious Operation Hammer in which 14,000 people—mostly young Black men—were arrested and booked in mobile command centers during a massive paramilitary occupation of south LA's deindustrialized ghettos.”27\nPerhaps one might have hoped for changes under the Clinton Democrats despite their move to the center. The early months of 1993, Mauer says, “represented a time of cautious optimism for criminal justice reform” thanks to a growing awareness of racial disparities in the criminal justice system and numerous well-articulated proposals of alternatives to prison. In less than a year, however, “this optimistic scenario had been transformed\n",
