In opposition to the papal hierocratic view, the emperors developed the doctrine of Caesaro-papism, which declared that the emperor had divine authority to rule over religious as well as imperial affairs.102 And in fact, in 325, Constantine asserted control over the Church by convoking at Nicaea the first ecumenical or universal council of bishops; the council’s Nicaean Creed resolved a dispute regarding the divinity of Jesus as the Son of God.103 Hence, almost immediately after converting to Christianity, Constantine effectively created and implemented the Caesaropapist approach.104\nThe second consequence of the Roman establishment of Christianity was to infuse the Church (and Christianity in general) with additional power. For instance, establishment enabled the papacy to begin operating as a governmental institution,105 and Christians suddenly held positions of authority within society. Thus, establishment supplied the power needed to speed (and to enforce) the spread of Christianity throughout the empire.106 Moreover, establishment supplied Christians with the power necessary to begin persecuting members of other religions. In fact, the Edict of 380, which officially established Christianity as the Roman religion, also officially condemned all other religions:\n\nWe desire all people, whom the benign influence of our clemency rules, to turn to the religion which tradition from Peter to the present day declares to have been delivered to the Romans by blessed Peter the Apostle … ; this faith is that we should believe, in accordance with apostolic discipline and Gospel teaching, that there is one Godhead, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in an equal Majesty and a holy Trinity. We order those who follow this doctrine to receive the title of Catholic Christians, but others we judge to be mad and raving and worthy of incurring the disgrace of heretical teaching, nor are their assemblies to receive the name of churches. They are to be punished not only by Divine retribution but also by our own measures, which we have decided in accordance with Divine inspiration.107\n\nThe third consequence of the Roman establishment of Christianity was to reinforce the emperor’s power in at least two ways. First, Christian religious doctrine encouraged ordinary people to focus on other-worldly salvation and not on this-worldly political power; indeed, as already discussed, the New Testament explicitly instructed Christians to “[r]ender to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” Civil obedience was religiously countenanced. Second, the emperor’s power was solidified through the process of centralization. Previously, throughout the empire, pagan rituals and ceremonies had helped citizens to identify strongly with their respective cities as opposed to the empire itself.
