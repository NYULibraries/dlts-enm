But, except among Marxists, who remain the most historically literate among political economists, the Austrian argument that suppression of market institutions inexorably produces calculational chaos remains unfamiliar to mainstream economists, especially in the United States.\nHow does the calculation argument (as the Austrian argument has come to be called) bear upon the prospect for market socialism of the sort envisaged by Rawls? As the Austrian argument is stated in Hayek’s decisive papers of the Thirties,32 it is successful against the Lange-Lerner model of socialism in which a central planning authority simulates market processes by shadow prices. Its relevance to the very different market socialism of worker-managed enterprises (which I take to be Rawls’s conception of it) should be no less clear. In this model, most factors of production, including labor but excluding capital, are subject to market pricing. The wage relation is abolished in that all workers are owner-managers of socialist enterprises that compete with each other for markets, but workers may not alienate their share in their enterprise, and investment capital is obtained from a public investment bank. Whereas market socialism on this model achieves a considerable measure of decentralization of economic decision-making, it remains authentically socialist (but thoroughly un-Marxian)33 in virtue of the communal ownership and consequent individual inalienability of socialist enterprises and because productive capital is obtainable only from state investment banks. These aspects of market socialism merely illustrate its constitutive institutional features—that the hiring of labor by capital and the investment of capital in enterprises for the profit of others apart from those who work in them are forbidden. Capitalists and proletarians are, in this model, abolished and replaced by a single class of worker-managers of enterprises that remain themselves communally owned.\nMarket socialism on this model (an imperfect variant of which has been attempted in Yugoslavia)34 has many incidental disadvantages. The fusion of job-holding with access to profits from capital, which is central to the system, makes enterprises reluctant ",
