            "pageText": "or what Chatterjee (2004) has called “political society,” the DRP’s early planning process seems to reveal a less antagonistic form of engagement more akin to the negotiations undertaken with civil society or middle-class “citizen groups.” These engagements were, at least in part, the product of project administrators’ desire to facilitate a smooth and relatively uncontested development process, particularly in light of their efforts to court international investment and undertake the type of developments believed to bolster Mumbai’s standing as a world-class city. When earlier development schemes were launched in the 1970s and 1980s, they were financed by either government funds or World Bank loans, and their work was undertaken by government workers and civil servants, not the large domestic and foreign developers participating in the DRP. Project delays and negative publicity were anticipated on these projects and not as actively avoided. Given the volatility of real estate investment and the risks associated with global land speculation—revealed only too clearly in the global financial meltdown in the fall and winter of 2008—Mehta and Shinde worked to avoid delays and negative publicity and reduce some of these risks. In doing so, they engaged with Dharavi’s political society to subdue opposition before it arose or immediately once it did. Amid the bourgeois revolution that Chatterjee and others have shown has diminished the state’s interest to work with these groups, pressures for private and globally oriented development may also be creating the conditions for deeper or at least a different type of democratic engagement.\n      If we are to understand this engagement as a form of urban democracy, it is important to recognize the democratic consequences of Mehta’s and Shinde’s efforts to co-opt potential opponents within Dharavi. These efforts are strikingly similar to the process of co-optation first identified by Philip Selznick in the context of local planning efforts for projects under the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the 1940s. In both the TVA and the DRP, the efforts to bring the local community on board entailed a series of negotiations and compromises on both sides. While Selznick (1966 [1949]) found that through the process of co-optation, substantive power remained in the hands of the project planners, he also conceded that the involvement of the local community had significant influence on the scheme’s outcomes. While we tend to think of co-optation as a one-sided interaction in which minority groups are bought off and assimilated into the majority, Selznick presents it as a two-way interaction akin to negotiation or mediation. This two-way dynamic must be emphasized if we are to think of co-optation as a form—albeit an imperfect form—of democratic engagement.37\n      ",
