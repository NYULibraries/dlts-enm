The answer to every one is no. “Shit,” T.C. says. “Oooh shit.” It appears he might become ill.\nWhen they pull up in front of Friends everything is very quiet. Holgate can hear the electric hum of the sign above the door, that and the car ticking down, but nothing else—nothing else moves. T.C. is dressed in a black warm-up suit and a foolish cowboy hat. He is holding himself very stiffly and in the silence begins breathing through his teeth and Holgate knows right then he is not going to do it.\n“You know how to drive?” Holgate asks.\nT.C. glares at him. “What you savin’, I’m scared? I won’t go in there?”\n“I’m sayin’ if you know how to drive.”\nOn the seat between them lay two empty whiskey bottles. The gun and stocking mask are in a gym bag on the floor. T.C. looks down at the bottles and then up again at Holgate. “Of course I know how to motherfucking drive.”\n“Good.” Holgate tucks the gun into his waistband and picks up the gym bag.\n",
