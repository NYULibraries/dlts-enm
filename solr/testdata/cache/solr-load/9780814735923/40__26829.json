He stopped and talked to the hardcore unemployed young black men who hung out in the tiny park on the corner of Ellis and Fillmore. He passed the old winos and saw the contours of his own future in the faces of all those jobless men. He saw the pawnshop and decided to pawn the derringer to buy some food for Elaine and Kamisha. He stood in line, but the pawnshop was crowded and it seemed to be taking forever. He left, walked another block, and stood in front of the First Western Bank. He saw that the bank was empty. Then, as if propelled, he was inside the bank.\nThe next morning Steven sat in a jail cell on the seventh floor of the courthouse known to Bay Area radicals as “The Hall of Injustice.” At the same time Dee Reid sat at her kitchen table scanning the San Francisco Chronicle for an article about the bank robbery.

Francisco had been harassed by police for passing out the organization’s newspaper, Basta Ya (Enough Already!). I took Dee Reid’s call and agreed to go to the jail and interview this bank robber.\nThe loud, harsh clanking of the steel doors, the stink of food and sweat—I was entering San Francisco County Jail, where federal prisoners were held in custody. Steven and I met in one of the tiny, airless rooms set aside for lawyer-client conferences. Steven was both mistrustful and happy.
