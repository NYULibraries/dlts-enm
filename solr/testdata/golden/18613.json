            "pageText": "one human group can be instantiated in all the other groups. Perhaps the manifestations of human conduct are more different than what lies beneath them and explains them. Or perhaps experiences vary more than do the explanations of their uniqueness, explanations tending as such toward uniformity because they have to obey the rules of common logic and be put in words whose generality obscures the uniqueness they attempt to express.\ne. Especially when doing fieldwork, which required them to be sensitive to context but to remain strangers within it, the anthropologists were half in and half out of context, or in a confused or ambiguous context. This ambiguity, in a weaker form, also characterized the criminal who read a great deal of criminology and the journalist who interviewed him sympathetically. It characterized, as well, the specialists in American Indian literature who denied or minimized the likeness to Western literature and kept trying to establish the Indian countercontext, as if they wanted to live in and out of two worlds, explaining to the inhabitants of each that they were strangers in the other.\nIt seems that the experts in explaining the mutual strangeness of different cultures had to become strangers themselves in order to be able to do their work. Anthropologists were heard explaining their alienation, and the alienation of two anthropological informants was described, though one of them had adjusted well to the framework that she and other pioneers in cultural contact had established. Bharati, the Viennese-American Hindu, was also in and out of his two (or more) cultures and defined himself as an intercontex-tual critic of cultures. Even the desire to revive a cultural tradition required a certain alienation from it. I mean by this that the revivals of tradition, whether in their American Indian or Hindu forms, showed themselves to be partly false to their professed intentions and, contextually speaking, hybrid.\nThe anthropologists, it is true, defined and criticized themselves and, at their best, retained what objectivity was possible in the ambiguous situations in which they placed themselves. But it seems that it was easier for them to hold the ideal of objectivity than to become objective in practice. Think only of the difficulty of the observers to observe and at the same time take account of the ",
