Whatever the case might have been, Jay’s mind gravitated toward “systems” and far-reaching “objects,” not to the relatively staid, circumscribed world of legal research and writing. Arguably, he also had developed a taste for the spotlight, which federal courts rarely attracted. For these and other reasons, he finally branded the federal judiciary a “defective” department without sufficient “energy, weight and dignity” to provide that “due support” upon which the republic’s future seemed to depend.79\nAfter 1794, Jay resolved anew “to see things as . . . they are, to estimate them aright, and to act accordingly”—a reassertion of “Fortitude founded on Resignation.” He then pressed his position on the debt question relentlessly through diplomacy. Apparently neither Jay nor Washington perceived conflict between service as a “private gentleman” on diplomatic assignment and as chief justice: the envoyship to Jay was simply a necessary, if personally inconvenient, exercise of duty and expertise. The president granted his envoy virtually a free hand with unpaid debts. Jay, he recalled, had been “personally conversant” with negotiators in Paris, served as foreign affairs secretary, and witnessed “what has passed in our [federal] courts” respecting confiscated property. Few men could claim so much.80\nAnd fewer still were so determined. England, Jay warned, would surely “insist that British debts, so far as injured by lawful impediments, should be repaired by the United States, by decision of mutual commissioners.” He expected disapprobation, without which he would have been “agreeably disappointed”; he also hoped to ease his conscience. “Should the treaty prove . . . beneficial,” he announced, “justice will finally be done. If not, be it so—my mind is at ease.” In a revealing letter, Jay (who had been nominated in absentia by New York Federalists to run for governor) told Randolph that the debt-related Sixth Article addressed “that justice and equity which judicial proceedings may, on trial, be found incapable of affording,” for a neutral commission could do “exactly what is right.” Anxiety and anger ",
