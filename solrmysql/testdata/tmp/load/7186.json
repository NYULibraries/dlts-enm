In fact, all the youth we interviewed at IC’s second Fourth Estate explicitly saw themselves as members of the millennial generation, a generation that they felt had been unfairly criticized for its apathy regarding civic life. Generally identified as those born between 1982 and 2004, millennials have indeed been front and center in debates focused on attitudinal and sociocultural shifts. As a Time magazine headline from May 20, 2013—“Me, Me, Me Generation: Millennials Are Lazy, Entitled Narcissists Who Still Live with Their Parents”—suggests, much of the negative commentary around this generation has centered on the premise that they are self-centered, rely on external support, and do not care about the world around them.
