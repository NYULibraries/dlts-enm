His blood was invested in the Republic.\nThe founders used images of family and fraternal trust to outline the appropriate relationship between great leaders and common citizens. Noah Webster ridiculed “the man who, as soon as he has married a woman of unsuspected chastity, locks her up in a dungeon,” just as he condemned the practice of voters to elect political leaders only immediately to “arm ourselves against them as against tyrants and robbers.” Nathanael Emmons argued for a presumption of mutual confidence among all members of Americas political family as a basis for criticizing individuals who “trample on human authority” with their “unruly spirit” or “restless, discontented, seditious spirit,” foolishly thinking that they played “a noble, manly, patriotic part” when they actually behaved like little boys by “weakening the hands of rulers and destroying the energy of government.” Emmons’s message was that “nothing but absolute necessity can justify . . . breaking the bands of society.” Ultimately, John Adams insisted, the Heroic Man deserved to be respected by “every manly mind.” He was resisted only by children.49\nThe Heroic Man fortified public trust by appearing in public as the citizen’s friend. Israel Evans observed that “exalted characters in authority feel themselves connected to the whole community by a brotherly, benevolent attachment.” Public expressions of fraternal feeling reassured men that their “lives and estates” were “secure.” Great leaders neither flaunted high status nor called attention to the social distance that separated them from commoners. Instead, they self-consciously identified with ordinary men and befriended them “to establish esteem and confidence between the people and their rulers.” Especially important, great leaders conducted themselves with what Peres Fobes described as “an affable deportment, a complacency of behavior, and such conciliating manners as cannot fail to secure the most commanding influence over the people.”50 Leaders fortified hegemony with civility.\nThe debate over the Constitution raised the issue of whether the sheer size of the new national government would preclude leaders from cultivating a sense of fellow feeling with most citizens. Antifederalists argued that the great geographical extent of the proposed polity and the huge numbers of men composing each electoral district worked against the likelihood that national leaders would be widely recognized, known, respected, or befriended by citizens. “Brutus” complained, “The people . . . will have very little acquaintance with those who may be chosen to represent them; a greater part of them will probably not know the characters of their own members much ",
