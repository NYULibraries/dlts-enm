            "pageText": "This led to a second and final divorce and eventually to psychotherapy on release from prison after a conviction on that charge.\nThe patient had never known his father, who had died in the war. He had grown up with his mother and his sister, who was two years older than he. When he was twelve he was sent to a welfare institution for frequently running away from home. There he had his first homosexual relationships with boys of the same age. His future wife, the sister of a social worker in the children’s home, was much more sexually experienced than he. In therapy it soon became clear that small hands had a particular erotic importance for the patient (a common phenomenon with pedophiles). In the tram he could not resist grabbing hold of the hand of a foreign-looking child and holding it tight for several stops. In addition to his obviously dominant position, it was the delicate little hand that created an important precondition for his sexual striving and the impulse to act it out. In the course of therapy the patient got to know a much younger woman. Here too he found that his intellectual superiority played a sexually stimulating role. The strangely split relationship with this partner became clear in a scenario in which he would go for a walk with her in the park and sense a deep, pleasurable feeling of security on holding her hand and feeling its pressure. This can be compared with the feeling of being held. At the same time, he sought to avoid being seen with this woman, whom he despised both for her unfortunate taste in clothes and also for her silliness. He feared being despised by others for being her partner.\nThe importance of holding hands and stroking plays a role not only for this patient. Another of my patients was caught by the police only because he could not resist ostentatiously walking hand-in-hand with a child he had seduced. A third patient described his main sexual fantasy as the idea of touching girls’ delicate hairless genitals with his fingers. As he spoke of this, he continually uttered the word “delicate” in an emotional way. Another relatively young pedophilic patient recorded his fantasies in the form of children’s comics that he drew himself. He was fixated on children’s hands and lower arms; here fluffy hair and protruding veins were major elements of his arousal. But it was not only the hands and arms that figured prominently in his fantasy, but the acts of clinging and holding on. This is further demonstrated in the following example.\n",
