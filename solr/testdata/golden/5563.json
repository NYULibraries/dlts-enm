            "pageText": "\nfemale skateboarders have been relegated to the mainstream press (deemed inauthentic by skaters) because niche skateboarding publications (deemed authentic) have refused to print them.9 Even programs purportedly aimed toward including female extreme sports athletes manage to maintain men as the standard-bearers in extreme sports culture, Michele K. Donnelly observes.10 Although I never defined myself as a skateboarder within this culture, my gender still pushed me to the sidelines.\nI have carried the relationships from my youth into my relationships with Michigan skateboarders, and, though I have known many of the boys for five years, I still find myself hanging out on the margins, watching as they act, laughing along with jokes I don't find particularly funny, and shyly asking them to explain the context of particular comments. At the same time, I have been invited to their graduation parties, gone to dinner with them, kept in touch via the Internet, and spent afternoons watching them skateboard with and without my husband. I am an insider watching from the outside, an outsider with a history of peering in. My position on the borders of this community—a borderland constructed primarily through my gender and secondarily through my age and position as a researcher—has been a privileged location for an ethnographer, a location affording me an insider's access, through my history and my husband's skate culture cachet, to both the community and knowledge of its norms and the outsider's insight into the peculiarity of those norms.\nIn the beginning years of my friendship with skater boys, skateboarding's relationship to popular culture began to shift. In 1995, when the television sports network ESPN launched The Extreme Games, later branded The X Games, the age of extreme began. Tony Hawk, who was already well known to skateboarders in the 1980s, became the mainstream face of skateboarding, and the practice began its journey (some might say descent) into a culture of cool.11 During the late 1980s or early 1990s, my friends had seen Tony Hawk up close and in person during a skateboarding demo (demonstration) in a McDonald's parking lot in Erie, Pennsylvania. They had been called “skater fags” throughout their middle school years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and some endured such treatment into their high school years. In 1993, a self-proclaimed jock brutally beat one of our friends after school one day; the victim was an extremely talented skateboarder, swimmer, and artist who occasionally had the audacity to wear skirts to school.
