Whereas earlier in the century social scientists had used the presumed biological inferiority of Blacks as a way to excuse white racism, many radical scholars feel that today the explanation of cultural deficiency is used by some social scientists, and others in the sphere of public policy, to excuse persistent white racism.\nThat Steinberg has had the expansion of affirmative action on his mind all along is evinced in a later volume in which he finally reveals the ultimate goal behind denying the importance of cultural differences in American life. Steinberg’s attempt to prove that Blacks continue to face a unique and debilitating level of discrimination in Turning Back: The Retreat from Racial Justice in American Thought and Politics is apparently motivated by his perception that the system of race preferences is under attack.9 Reflecting the extreme cultural relativism that informs so much of the literature on race today, Steinberg admits that he is deeply offended by suggestions that certain groups possess cultural traits that result in greater economic success than certain other groups. There is something wrong with presupposing that “we have qualities that they are lacking,” Steinberg insists, and his logic for doing so is simple. If it can be shown that all white European immigrant groups had more or less equal access to economic opportunities from which Blacks were excluded, then the present system of compensatory treatment based on race is made, not only more palatable, but necessary and just. It is not an accident, then, that this effort to erase the cultural distinctiveness of white ethnic groups has occasionally emphasized American Jews. It is the Jews, after all, who stand out in the public conscience as having the strongest claim to historical victimization and whose affluence appears to have defied what structural determinists like Steinberg predict should happen when people are deprived of opportunities for advancement. If it is possible to prove not only that Jews received certain advantages not available to Blacks but that the privileges accruing to those with white skin were the primary catalyst for Jewish advancement, it would go a long way toward justifying racial preferences.\nCentral to the effort to “whiten” the American Jewish experience has been the denial of Jewish exceptionalism, the idea that the Jewish experience in America has been unique. The remarkable economic advance of Jews into the middle and upper classes has inspired a number of observers over the years to conclude that Jewish culture seems to have been exceptionally well disposed to the American ideals of universalism, equality, individualism, and free markets.10 Almost half a century ago, the sociologist ",
