I thought that Chase was also something less of a trimmer than was John Marshall, particularly on the issues of judicial review and the independence of the federal judiciary, and I thought that it was time that Chase received some credit for the courage he demonstrated in sticking to his principles.\nBy the late eighties, when I was trying to put the manuscript into book form, events in Europe and America suggested that the turn to the left in national and European politics was coming to something of an end, and I thought that closer scrutiny of an old conservative approach might have resonance for today. This seems to have been realized by at least one prominent formerly left-leaning American historian,29 and it is true as well that, at long last, the Supreme Court might be poised to reexamine some of what has usually been characterized as the “liberal” decisions of the Warren and Burger Courts, particularly those regarding race and religion. Can the study of Chase’s trials and tribulations help in the working out of a jurisprudence for the twenty-first century?\nOr is this question even appropriate? This sort of teleological approach flies in the face of much that some (perhaps most) current American historians hold dear. Conceivably practicing history for its own sake, they look with jaundiced mien on those whose study of history follows the directive of Santayana. For example, David Thomas Konig, a distinguished colonial legal historian, writing a few pungent paragraphs in a key professional journal for American historians, the American Historical Review, stated that The Original Misunderstanding “must be read with great caution and an awareness of its intended ‘relevance for the present.’”30\nKonig, all but dismissing the book as “idiosyncratic,” suggested that I drew “broadly, indiscriminately and reductionistically on numerous elements of eighteenth century thought.”31 I suppose I was a reductionist, as must be anyone who tries to capture the unmanageable sprawl of reality in the pages of a book, although I thought I worked with more discrimination than Konig apparently was willing to allow. Indeed, Konig’s review is a rather dangerous exercise in reductionism itself. Konig found “dubious” what he called my assertion that “Americans understood no distinction between the law of nations and ... a federal common law,” while all I was doing was stating ",
