            "pageText": "Cammermeyer’s case is also of particular interest because her discharge preceded the adoption of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy The revelation of her sexual orientation occurred because she was asked a direct question, a question she refused to answer dishonestly Under the new policy, Cammermeyer would presumably not have been asked such a question and so would not have been classified as a homosexual by the military. Consequently, her military career would never have been placed in jeopardy. This shift in military policy illustrates that homosexuality, and the definition of who is homosexual, is not an unchanging universal but instead a social construction, in this case a creation of the military. Through the Cammermeyer case and the larger debate over gays and lesbians in the military, the social construction of homosexuality is carried out at a level of visibility rarely available, affording an unusual glimpse of this work in process.\nMore specifically, Cammermeyer would not be identified as a lesbian under the new policy, presuming that she continued to act as she always had, keeping her sexual orientation a secret. Therefore she would, for all practical purposes, not be a lesbian under military policy. Thus she could have remained in the service and likely received the security clearance and the promotion she sought. Perhaps equally revealing is the fact that if Cammermeyer had been willing to retract her statement, as she was requested to do several times during the course of the proceedings against her, she would probably have been allowed to remain in the military until her retirement, despite the “knowledge” the military had already obtained about her sexuality.\nTechnically, the civil case Cammermeyer brought against the Department of Defense challenged only the old policy under which she was separated from military service. However, by the time Cammermeyer’s case reached the Ninth Circuit Court, where it was to be heard, this policy was no longer in effect. “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was announced by Clinton in July 1993 and went into effect on February 28, 1994. The ruling on Cammermeyer’s case was issued on June 1, 1994. Yet, as her case and the broader debate about gays and lesbians in the military reveal, the differences between the old and new policies are negligible, and the two policies ultimately stand or fall as one (Bull 1994).\nIn the first section of this chapter, I examine the background and significance of the military’s policies on homosexuality, exploring the nature of the ban itself. By investigating the relationship between homophobia, racism, and sexism in military ideology, I show how the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the military arises from the gendered nature of the organization and its preoccupation with upholding an image of heterosexual ",
