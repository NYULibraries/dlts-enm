            "pageText": "ideal now, in the midst of a market-oriented world, by greatly increasing landlordsâ€™ duties of habitability and curtailing their profits? Or will this backfire and make the gulf between landlords and tenants even worse? Or should we stick with a largely free-market regime, hoping for happy, generous landlords and a trickle-down effect? Or will this further entrench the nonideal market order and push our ideal farther away?\nThe problem of transition to a better world, to the world of our theories of justice, is the problem of politics. The transition never ends; we are always in medias res. In making our decisions in practice we must recognize that those decisions not only move either toward or away from our ideals, they also continually help us to reshape those ideals, for better or for worse.\nThe intractability of the takings issue arises not just from the multiplicity of issues, and not just from the difficulties with contestedness and the Rule of Law, but also from our inability to specify in any general way when we should be governed by the ideal and when we should pay attention instead primarily to the nonideal. Always in the midst of the transition, we are always unsure when we should lean toward theory and our hopes for progress and when toward practical politics and our realistic appraisal of the world as it is.\nThe overriding ideal concern that makes the takings issue intractable is that a general solution demands a fully worked-out theory of justified property holding, which depends upon a theory of politics and the person. The contestedness of moral and political theory relating to property renders our ideals uncertain and conflicting. Perhaps we should consider its very contestedness to be nonideal. At any rate, this central ideal problem with our world of theory shades over into the nonideal, into corrective justice, our deep commitment that wrongs about property must be righted.\nThe need for corrective justice reflects our nonideal circumstances: wrongs happen. Corrective justice nevertheless has an aspect that relies on ideal theory. Commitment to a theory of justified property holding is necessary to identify cases of wrongful holding in which corrective justice is called for. Corrective justice also has a more immediate nonideal aspect. Corrective justice fades out in favor of the status quo. It fades out ",
