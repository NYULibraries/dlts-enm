            "pageText": "The indictment charged these defendants both with operating the commission through a pattern of racketeering activity and with conspiring to operate it as a racketeering enterprise. The government alleged that the commission’s raison d’etre was to “regulate and facilitate the relationships between and among La Cosa Nostra families.” Through the enterprise, the defendants were alleged to have engaged in or aided and abetted authorization of murders, narcotics trafficking, loansharking, and infiltration of labor unions. The indictment also charged that the commission “maintained its authority by identifying itself with threats and violence.”\nIn support of the commission’s existence, the indictment included a history of the commission’s membership and activities. It named the leaders of the five families that had been represented on the commission since its formation in 1931, including, among others, Vito Genovese, Thomas Lucchese, Joseph Colombo, Carlo Gambino, and Albert Anastasia.\nThe indictment charged all of the defendants except Indelicato with utilizing their dominance over the District Council of the Concrete and Cement Workers Union to organize and oversee a “concrete club,” a cartel of concrete contractors. The operation of the concrete club was the basis for thirteen counts of extorting money from contractors and six labor bribery counts. In addition, Corallo and Santoro were charged with participating in a Staten Island loansharking conspiracy, and Indelicato was charged with furthering the purposes of the commission by murdering Carmine Galante, Leonard Coppola, and Giuseppe Turano, three mob figures who opposed the commission’s chosen candidate during its reorganization of the Bonanno crime family.\nThus, the government painted organized crime as a sprawling criminal conglomerate whose activities ranged from garden-variety vice rackets to murder, labor racketeering, bid rigging, and unfair competition in the construction industry. It also presented a vague picture of the commission as a Cosa Nostra court and as a board of managers pursuing its own criminal enterprises.\nThe Prosecution\nThe trial began on September 8, 1986.7 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Chertoff, John Savarese, and John Childers conducted the prosecution. Federal district judge Richard Owen presided at the trial. Carmine Persico represented himself, a strategy that enabled him to address the jury directly without exposing himself to cross-examination; some of the nine-weeklong trial’s most dramatic moments involved Persico’s cross-examinations ",
