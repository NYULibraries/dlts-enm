            "pageText": "outward from some centrally located sector in society, creating a homogeneous familiarity. The scientific logic that made the industrial revolution possible asserts itself as “an autonomous, thoroughly secular perspective on the world,” making what was formerly sacred and mysterious continuous with the mundane world of everyday existence.70 “A sky empty of angels becomes open to the intervention of the astronomer and, eventually, of the astronaut,” writes Berger.71 Religion is relegated to the marketplace, where it presents itself as a balm in the lives of private individuals.72 Again, the focus turns from the transcendent to the immanent and the atomic, the self. It is from this position that the antireligious nature of pluralism, defined by Berger as “a social-structural correlate of the secularization of consciousness,” 73 can be most clearly seen.\nIn The Brothers Karamozov, Dostoevsky presents the potentialities of a world where God is absent. “When there is no God, everything is permitted,” is Ivan’s refrain. If there is no God, no absolute truth, there is no law, no ordonnance, no basis for prohibition.74 The consequences are at once liberating and terrifying. On the one hand, it appears that those whom the old morality has oppressed are given license, since the moral and legal justifications for oppression are sundered. On the other hand, the oppressed lose all moral claims on the oppressor. At first glance, it may seem that the absence of moral claims on either side is no more static than are moral claims in competition. The critical difference, though, lies in the fact that the absence of moral claims forecloses the possibility of moral debate completely. Moral claims at a point of stasis presume a tension that may be broken or resolved. Secular argument is flaccid and inert.\nNegotiation, as opposed to the proclamation of prophecy, is the form of secular debate. Secular debate reflects the economic values of its time by assuming the form of the so-called “rational exchange model” or “game theory.”75 Unlike the absolutisms of moral argument, all positions in rational economic argument are bargainable; the old ethic of exclusion and prohibition is replaced by tolerance. As Robert Paul Wolff has written,\nTolerance in a society of competing interest groups is precisely the ungrudging acknowledgment of the right of opposed interests to exist and be pursued. The economic conception of tolerance goes quite naturally with the view of human action as motivated by interests rather than principles or norms. It is much easier to accept a compromise between competing interests—particularly when they are expressible in terms of a numerical scale like money—than between opposed principles which purport to be objectively valid.76\n",
