In Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, the Court stated that “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if the regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. . .” 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922).\n5. See, for example, Michelman, “Property, Utility, and Fairness”; Richard Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985); and Bruce Ackerman, Private Property and the Constitution (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977).\n6. See, for example, Cass R. Sunstein, “Lochner’s Legacy,” ColumbiaLaw Review 87 (1987): 873.\n7. We also need to know how long Susan has been there, and whether the circumstances are such that we ought to treat Susan’s claim as paramount to John’s in view of the length of time she has been trespassing. If she has been trespassing long enough to have gained title by adverse possession, then she can be treated as the rightful owner. In cases that deviate from this kind of simple paradigm, however, it is much more difficult to say how we should weigh the length of time the wrongful claim has been exercised, as against its wrongfulness at its inception. I will have more to say about this problem in section A.3 below.\n8. The problem is further complicated by the fact that it may matter whether the value is lowered only in the current holder’s perception, or whether indeed the market value is lowered (that is, the value is lowered in the perception of what we would consider an “average” holder). It also may matter whether the injury appears normatively to be merely a lowering of monetary value, or whether the personhood of the holder appears to be infringed upon. (See section I.B below.) These concerns may pull in opposite directions, further complicating the issue. That is, we may intuitively feel that “mere” lowering of value in one’s own perception is not entitled to as much weight as lowering of market value, yet we may feel that injury to personhood is entitled to more weight than “mere” lowering of market value.\n9. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, American Law Institute, (1979), Sec. 882. (For nontrespassory invasion to be the source of liability it must be (i) intentional and unreasonable (ii) unintentional and otherwise actionable under the rules controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct, or for abnormally dangerous conditions or activities.)\n",
