            "pageText": "\nhis pilot is, technically, an alien, Albator wanders somewhere through space in his pirate ship—these texts unmistakably adhere to the highly marked aesthetic of classic Japanese animation. Candy flaunts a prototypical 1970s shôjo (girl) manga look, while Goldorak draws from the equally recognizable tradition of Japanese robot/transformer/superheroes from outer space (his “color scheme” and “facial features” are reminiscent of Ultra Man’s, and he is constantly fighting dragon-like robotic monsters). In other words, while these texts are not ostensibly set in a Japanese context and do not propose to “represent” aspects of Japanese culture—there are subtle references to Japanese daily life in Goldorak (such as when the characters eat onigiri) but these are mixed in with loads of references to other cultural environments—they are strongly visually marked as Japanese or, at least, different. As one French media consumer in her 20s explained, “Goldorak and all that, they didn’t have the same look [pas la même tête] as the other cartoons” or, as a 46-year-old woman similarly recalled, “I think that we started to realize where cartoons came from when the Japanese entered the production scene [. . .] First of all, it was a new graphic style, and also, a new generation of cartoons that didn’t look like what we had seen until then.”\nFrench media consumers came to associate these texts’ visual features—color scheme, lines, editing—with their Japanese origin. As a 40-year-old female informant recalled, “I think that I knew that when they had big eyes, it was Japanese, because there was a particular drawing style [un graphisme particulier]. . . . Yes, Candy, Goldorak, I knew it was Japanese. . . . It was in relationship to the graphic elements that we could recognize that.” Thus, as French cultural critic François Hermelin puts it, “For years, starting at the end of the 1970s, the Japanese cartoon series [séries de dessins animés japonais] that poured onto the European airwaves prepared the younger generation for the stereotypes of the Japanese genre” (2000, p. 142). These distinctive features are still easily identifiable today—as a 19-year-old man explained, “They don’t have the same eyes . . . They have big eyes, the Japanese [characters] they have big round eyes”—even though they have been adapted to a variety of non-Japanese texts: “Now [the animated series] Totally Spies!, they do the same kind of thing, even though it is French”4 (40-year-old woman).\nFurthermore, because of limited production budgets, visual elements pointing to anime’s Japanese origins could not always be erased when the genre first entered the French cultural context. As a Goldorak viewer in his 40s recalled, “When they went places . . . it was written in Japanese, and that is something that impressed me, because if they went to a store and picked up a can or something, it was written in Japanese on it.” Japanese writing in kanji and kana (the two sets of characters used to write Japanese) appeared in titles, credits, or in the opening scenes of these early shows.
