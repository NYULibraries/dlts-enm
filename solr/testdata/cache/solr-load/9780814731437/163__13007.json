            "pageText": "colonies a comeuppance. Internally, some poor crop years, a decadelong depression, plus the astonished unwillingness of established seaboard elites to share power with the ordinary farmers and artisans who had actually fought the Revolution had created internecine squabbling, intermittent revenue collection, and frequent control of legislatures by anticommercial soft-money forces that issued paper money and enacted other debt-avoidance measures. Flare-ups of farm folk, artisans, and wage workers culminated in Shays’s Rebellion in New England—a serious revolt not finally subdued until after the Constitutional Convention assembled.\nA procommercial, prodevelopmental thread tied together those members of the elites who wished to reestablish the nation upon a stronger, more centralized basis. Both the ability to exercise armed might either in self-defense or in internal policing, and any permanent enlargement of the government meant that the national government must be given power over its own revenue. The ability to recruit naval aid by arming merchantmen as privateers, which in turn meant the ability to protect a revenue-producing merchant marine, implied the protection of prizes captured in war. Above all, in an increasingly trade-conscious and commodity-desirous world, to gain stability meant borrowing from European sources to finance trade, to stimulate manufactures, and to begin the development of the huge trans-Allegheny territories, the mere acquisition of which had already stimulated a competitive froth of land speculation amongst elites. Borrowing meant establishing credit. This in turn meant, as with any Third World country today, elimination of soft-money and other debtor-favoring practices, and neutralization of localistic and anticommercial juries. It also meant a better debt-payback record than existed with regard both to the huge and largely unpaid debts incurred by both states and the federal government in winning independence, and to the millions of dollars’ worth of debts owing from planters and farmers to English and Scottish merchants left unpaid at the onset of the Revolution and still mostly unpaid in 1787, because of lingering anti-British hostility plus the generally depressed circumstances. Policing meant criminal law; revenue protection meant the establishment of revenue jurisdiction; prize meant admiralty jurisdiction; and the neutralization of localism meant the establishment of independent federal courts with appropriate jurisdiction.\n",
