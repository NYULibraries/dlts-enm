            "pageText": "the fiction of authenticity. That technique was able to sidestep censorship, since any overtly political references are missing from the text, yet as a whole the collection throws into doubt the patriarchal assumptions underlying socialist gender legislation. It stresses the necessity to break the silence concealing individual differences, doubts, questions, experiments, errors, and variations in the process of becoming socialist. The book issued a call to replace egalitarianism as the foundational paradigm of socialism, with the acknowledgment and celebration of diversity. Wander’s collection stresses the necessity to mobilize individual fantasies and efforts for a shared ideological goal, if the socialist state did not want to put that very goal at risk. While criticizing “real existing” structures and practices, feminist literature like Wander’s collection took over the task of ideological interpellation which the state and its apparatuses performed with increasing difficulty.\nGood Morning, Beautiful applied categories of “private” experiences to public discourse when it suggested a politics proceeding from love and “sisterliness.” It also politicized the private as the realm of emotions and energies the state couldn’t afford not to tap as a powerful, national resource. Endeavoring to do just that, Wander’s book, while expanding the parameters of gender performance, duplicated certain silences and invisibilities within dominant discourse. Only with hindsight do the omissions become apparent. Despite the many erotic moments between women, representations of lesbian sexualities or life-styles are missing from this book, along with those dissident voices who did not share in the unspoken consensus of Wander’s interviewees, that socialism, despite its many flaws, was in any case preferable to capitalism.22 Like the drama, the protocol refrained from depicting nonheterosexual desires or inter-generational bonds among women, which took center stage in Western feminist discourse of the 1970s. Feminist literature in the GDR never contested the homophobic casting of the female subject’s commitment to an ideology administered by men in the terms of heterosexuality. Women writers challenged the dominant conflation of criticism with sabotage, yet implicitly agreed that a sexuality not oriented toward men was treason. Ursula Sillge’s book In-Visible Women, published in 1991, excavates a history of lesbian persecution in the GDR, which is based on that assumption.23\nGood Morning, Beautiful created a space for the discussion of questions and conflicts concerning gender — a space which the theater denied them.
