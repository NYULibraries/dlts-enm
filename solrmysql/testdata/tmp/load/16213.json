Let me ask you, sir, did you also engage in undercover activities while using the telephone?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And did you observe the same pattern of conversations used by narcotics dealers on the telephone?\nA. Yes. I heard the same patterns.\nQ.

And can you tell us what instructions you received?\nA.

Yes, it was common.\nQ. And in the 24 years you’ve been involved in narcotics investigations, have you observed persons who you were investigating for narcotics activity using pay telephones?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Is that true in the United States as well as in Italy?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And when you made—were you sometimes, in the course of undercover negotiations, given telephone numbers?\nA.
