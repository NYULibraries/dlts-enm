He spoke to their empathy, saying that “there is no difference between the love of a black man for his offspring and the love of a white.” He believed, and urged the jury to believe, that human experience allows us to “find each other and understand each other.” Having warned them to guard against their prejudice and to find common ground with persons of another race, he specifically told them he was confident that they could see past their prejudices and do justice.\nThe defense team’s strategy was to give meaning to the word “justice” by helping the jury see that a black family had the constitutional right to defend its home against any onslaught:\n\nIt has been the law of every English-speaking country so long as we have had law. Every mans home is his castle, which even the king may not enter. Every man has a right to kill, to defend himself or his family, or other, either in the defense of the home or in the defense of themselves.... There isn’t a man in Detroit who doesn’t know that the defendant did his duty, and that this case is an attempt to send him and his companions to prison because they defended their constitutional rights.\n\nAfter Darrow discussed the themes of racial prejudice and the constitutional right to protect one’s home, he explained the rule of self-defense: “A man has the right to shoot in self-defense, and in defense of his home; not when these vital things are in danger, but when he thinks they are.” Darrow correctly raised the issue of Henry Sweet’s state of mind. What facts had Henry known? What emotions had he felt that led him to reasonably and honestly believe that he and his family were in imminent danger? In answer to these questions, Darrow asked the jurors to put themselves in the Sweet house on that fatal night: “Put yourselves in their place. Make yourselves colored for a little while. It won’t hurt, you can wash it off. They can’t, but you can; just make yourself black for a little while; long enough, gentleman, to judge them.”\nDarrow then argued that Henry was well aware of the history of his race. Darrow talked movingly of that history, calling it a “story that would melt hearts of stone.” He talked of slavery, of lynching, of murders, and of riots against blacks in Washington, St. Louis, Chicago, and Detroit. Many of these examples had been elicited through Dr. Sweet’s testimony. But ",
