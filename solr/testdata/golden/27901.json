            "pageText": "puzzle piece in this functionalist approach to cultural change: the families that most eagerly bought into the new advice literature on emotional control came from the sectors of the middle class most involved in the managerial and service occupations. Arthur Jersild’s polling data about levels of parental concern over children’s emotional problems, including sibling jealousy, show that suburban families easily exceeded all others. The urban upper class and working class both lagged, rating other, nonemotional issues with children considerably more important. Miller and Swanson’s 1950s survey of Detroit families similarly showed, with a more extensive database, that managerial families were most interested in the newer approaches to childrearing, paying particular attention to strict emotional control by parent and child alike. Older middle-class families and traditional blue-collar families were noticeably less interested. Parents from entrepreneurial families, for example, admitted that they were far more likely than their managerial counterparts to punish children when angry and were less concerned if their children were angry as a result of discipline.57 That this same division generated a growing audience for the new standards was suggested in a number of other studies, particularly focused on the suburbs, of parents who explicitly sought (or claimed to seek) to counter the emotional guidelines their own parents had emphasized.58 Again, persistent economic change forced the reconsideration of Victorian emotionology and the development of norms in which intensity played no legitimate role. The same change spread from the workplace to other sites, including the family and childrearing, and it also produced the sectors of the middle class (some newly risen from labor and immigrant ranks) most attuned to the advice that resulted. A new functionalism assured both a radical shift in standards and a basis for their dissemination.\nThe economic shifts persisted, gaining momentum over time and so increasing the pressure to redefine emotional norms and to accept the redefinitions first widely sketched in the 1920s. Managerial bureaucracies became ever larger and more visible in terms of defining probable adult economic roles. The service sector, with its ubiquitous people-pleasing requirements, grew still more rapidly, and by the 1950s television, staffed by service-sector workers par excellence, helped translate the ever-smiling models of service success into daily viewing. The fuller participation of women in the work force during the 1950s and 1960s extended this aspect of the service economy, adding female stereotypes ",
