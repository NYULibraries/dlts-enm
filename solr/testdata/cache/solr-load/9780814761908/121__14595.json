            "pageText": "end result is a more civil society, one whose actors perform more altruistically. In the West an enormous increase in home ownership since World War II (30 percent in 1940, 66 percent in 1980) has turned people’s attention to problems of property and investment and to the local governments whose policies and actions affect this enormous stake in personal wealth. Added to this are problems of education, crime, and, most recently, the environment—a problem that links local to national and global affairs, thereby imposing public concerns onto private welfare. In the rest of the world, access to scarce resources, massive public sector corruption, human rights, personal security and liberties known to be enjoyed elsewhere, the importance of cultural traditions challenged by modernism and the state, and a host of other factors have led to increased concern for, attempts to participate in, and efforts to obtain greater control over, the public life of the state. Because of its critical and moral basis this effort has in some instances led to religious fundamentalism, or radical political movements, ethnic conflict, civil wars, and so on. But it is also leading to a worldwide democracy movement that is pressing for wider participation in, and sacrifice for, social groups beyond kin and ethnicity in the economy and the polity. A very probable outcome is the strengthening of civility—cultural demands and regulations that call for increased fairness, less egoistic, less parochial, and more civic-minded performances.\nSecondly, the end of Cold War tensions has eroded the backdrop of conflict influencing an inordinate amount of postwar public affairs. If the major powers are seeking a more civil way of solving differences, if time and effort spent on conflict is decreasing in the major arenas of national and international life, and if the means to increased development and human welfare do not in fact lie so clearly in conflict, then possibly we are on the verge of rejecting conflict as a viable or even fruitful way to solve problems. There are indications from all round the world that conflict-laden issues and relations are calming down, and that peaceful, more just, more civil solutions are not impossible. A cultural theme that has worldwide appeal, one of peaceful and hopefully increasingly fair resolutions of conflict, is quite measurably blanketing the world. Possibly it is just a momentary pause resulting from a lack of successful outcomes in the last few decades. Viet Nam and Afghanistan come to mind, but interethnic conflicts in the Third World, and both leftist and rightist extremism almost everywhere, ",
