The Constitution that resulted had an impact on the further development of science.\nFree Speech for Scientists\nThe most dramatic example of that impact came in the First Amendment’s requirement that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,” a restriction on government designed in part to assure freedom for scientists. America’s founders believed that the protection of civil liberties in a free state was essential to the growth of science, a growth they strongly favored. This idea found expression in the poems of the Jeffersonian journalist Philip Freneau, who wrote in “The Rising Glory of America” that without “sweet liberty … science irretrievably must die.”16 The Enlightenment union of political and scientific progress was also reflected in Freneau’s “On the Death of Dr. Benjamin Franklin”: “Who seized from Kings their sceptred pride, and turned the lightning’s darts aside!”17\nRittenhouse and Rush were among the numerous other writers and orators who explicitly linked scientific progress with civil liberty.18 Jefferson, in a 1789 letter to the president of Harvard College, concluded a call for research in botany, mineralogy, and natural history with the same message: “It is the work to which the young men, whom you are forming, should lay their hands. We have spent the prime of our lives in procuring them the precious blessing of liberty. Let them spend theirs in showing that it is the great parent of science and of virtue; and that a nation will be great in both always in proportion as it is free.”19\nThe notion that free speech applied to science was an inevitable result of the idea that proper political decisions came not from monarchical pronouncements but from the application of scientific thinking to social problems. Thus Jefferson, in opposing tariffs on learned treaties, observed that “[s]cience is more important in a republican than in any other government.”20 Indeed, Jefferson’s devotion to the free exchange of scientific ideas may have exceeded his devotion to the free exchange of political views that differed from his own.21\nThe intimate relation between science and civil liberty is illustrated in a 1774 letter from the Continental Congress to the inhabitants of Quebec that described freedom of the press as important in part because it ",
