When Kelley returned to Hope from New Orleans and began to work, she was often away and her mother “still held sway over [Bill].” She also apparently adored him and doted on him, but in ways that differed from how her daughter came to understand and act on these feelings. At one point Kelley notes that her mother “worshiped Bill” (1994a, 114). Elsewhere she remarks that her mother “would dress him and feed him and buy him things. Nothing was too fine or too expensive for her beloved grandson” (1994a, 83).\nEdith Cassidy also spent time teaching young Bill. Kelley attributes this to the fact that her mother had begun to focus her own ambition on the child, and perhaps this is the case. But it is also possible that Cassidy, herself an ambitious woman, wanted to give her grandson the tools to satisfy the ambitions he might develop. At any rate, she drilled her grandson on his numbers with homemade flash cards and played other learning games with him.\nDuring this period, Virginia and Roger began to date exclusively and her partying began in earnest but her mother “continued to be immune to Roger’s charms” (1994a, 83). When the couple decided to get married, Cassidy responded by trying to get legal custody of her grandson. Kelley attributes her mother’s attempt to gain custody of Bill to the “blackness inside her finally taking over,” but she also offers another, more revealing insight: “To her mind, Roger Clinton wasn’t fit to be under the same roof with Bill, and she said she was going to stop the possibility of it if she could” (1994a, 86). Edith Cassidy went to an attorney, who conveyed to her the facts of her position. As Kelley puts it, “The laws of the land prevailed” (1994a, 86). Still, it is an extraordinary incident, especially given the time and place. Kelley’s mother tried to gain custody of her grandson from her own daughter because she saw and disapproved of the life she was starting to live. She felt it would prove harmful to her grandson, and in retrospect she was right.\nCassidy continued to spend lots of time with her grandson while her daughter pursued her busy work and social life. Clinton has recalled his grandfather with greater fondness than his grandmother (Baer 1991, 40). Still, her intensive attention to him and her concern about him stand in stark contrast to his later family experiences. In a very revealing aside, Kelley notes that when the family moved to Hot Springs (and she and her husband became heavily involved in its nightlife), “Bill frequently went to visit his grandparents in Hope, leaving by bus on Friday and coming back ",
