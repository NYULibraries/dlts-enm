The judge’s response showed his awareness of racism and his genuine regard for the defendant.\n\nDon’t you understand Mr. Robertson doesn’t want your help.

The case was sent back to Judge Robinson for further proceedings.\nRobertson had a new attorney and consented to an insanity defense. However, once the jury was seated and voir dire began, Robertson could not go through with it and told the judge that he refused an insanity defense “for personal reasons of a quasi-political nature.” He went on to state the following: “I still say I am not insane.
