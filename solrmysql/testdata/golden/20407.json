Rob Verchick, in particular, tolerated frequent work interruptions with considerable good humor and supplied very helpful ideas.\nI wish to thank Toby Egan, Todd Jacobs, Jolie Justus, Amy Maloney, Eric Moss, and Shannon O’Brien for their superb research assistance. Debra Banister and Brooks Best provided efficient and precise administrative support.\nI am grateful to Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic for the inspiration of their work, as well as their endless patience and sheer brilliance in editing successive drafts of chapters, and to my editor, Niko Pfund, who provoked, cheered, and offered excellent advice.\nThis book would not have been possible without the love, support, and encouragement of Tim Geary, Aaron Geary, and Dylan Geary. It is dedicated to Marty Levit, for fathering, mothering, and living the ideals of a profeminist man before there were words to describe them.\n",
