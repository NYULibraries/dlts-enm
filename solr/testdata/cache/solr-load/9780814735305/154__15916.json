            "pageText": "nonlesbian sisters: many more lesbians said the election of a woman was of great importance, and the lesbian sample appears to be somewhat better educated than either gay men or nongay women.\nIn addition to the results above, two findings that I did not expect, and that do not relate directly to political attitudes or vote choice, must be noted. First, half of the lesbian self-identifiers report that they are not exclusively homosexual in orientationâ€”whereas four-fifths of the gay men say that they are!\nIn previous chapters I sought reasons why women should be less likely to call themselves homosexual than men, and speculated that social factors were principal causes: both norms regarding intimacy among women, which may make it more difficult for a woman to comprehend her feelings for another woman as having a sexual underpinning, and the fact that lesbians are significantly more likely to have custody of children, which the disclosure of their sexuality could affect adversely. It also is possible, of course, that women are less inclined physiologically to be homosexual than are men.\nThis result raises another possibility: that a disproportion of gay women actually do have sexual feelings for persons of both sexes, and that these women have a significantly greater degree of choice regarding toward whom their affections will be directed, which most men with same-sex attractions do not have. This cannot be determined in any definitive way from a sample of nineteen lesbian primary voters in the vicinity of Greenwich Village. But this observation should be followed up in future research on the nature of homosexuality.\nThe religion results, which near statistical significance, also give us some further guidance as to the source of religious differences within samples of self-identifiers noted in chapters 3 and 4. I speculated, based on the results of table 5.1, that once again the predominate religious tradition in the district had the effect of suppressing lesbian and gay self-identification among its adherents. But lesbians and nongays indicate that they are Jewish, Christian, or something else at identical rates; once again, the gay-straight differences are actually differences between the gay men and the rest of the sample.\nThis finding is not replicated in the national and state-level data, and it does not explain away the apparent suppressive effects of dominant religious tradition on self-identification at these levels reported in chapters 3 and 4. But it does show that, among downtown Manhattan Democrats, differences in religious affiliation between the straight and gay populations more likely are the result of gay male immigration. Thus, we must approach the causes of gay-straight religious differences with somewhat more caution.\n",
