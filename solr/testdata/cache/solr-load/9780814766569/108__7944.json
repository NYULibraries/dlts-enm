            "pageText": "After he recognizes his errors, Creon says that “it was a god” who drove him “to wild / strange ways” (1271–73), and the chorus observes that the “‘bad becomes the good / to him a god would doom’” (621–22). From a modern perspective, it is not the gods but Creon’s fears and compulsions that doom him.\nWhen the guard arrives with word that Polyneices has been buried, Creon immediately jumps to the conclusion that his enemies have bribed the sentinels to disobey his order, thus assimilating the event into his paranoid scenario. He accuses the guard of having sold his “mind for money” (322) and shows his power by threatening him with a terrible fate. This is not an isolated incident. Just before the guard arrived, he had warned the chorus “not to take sides with any who disobey” his edict (219), risking their lives for “hope of profit” (222). He later accuses Tiresias of pleading “a shameful case ... in hope of profit” (1047). Creon is prone to believe that people are conspiring against him, and he defends himself against feelings of personal inadequacy by attributing their behavior to greed. His complaint against Tiresias is absurd, but he can ignore the seer’s criticisms by calling him “money-mad” (1055). When Antigone is brought back a captive, Creon dismisses her charge that he has pridefully ignored the law of the gods and accuses her and Ismene of being “secret plotters” (494) against the throne.\nCreon is compulsively driven to condemn Antigone to death, an act that will destroy his family and his reign. He must prove that he places the state above bonds of kinship, as he has required others to do, and fears that he will lose face if he does not carry out his threat to execute anyone who disobeys his edict. His need to punish Antigone’s “insolence” (480) is all the greater because she is a woman: “I am no man and she the man instead / if she can have this conquest without pain” (485–86). Creon has a profound fear of being perceived as weak. He has an idealized image of himself as a masterful leader who can easily “bring raging horses back to terms” (478) and a despised image of himself as an impotent man who is not respected and cannot impose his rule. To allow Antigone to get the better of him would expose him to unbearable self-hate: “No woman rules me while I live” (526). To be ruled by Antigone is to be weaker even than a female.\nThe long speech to Haemon (639–80) in which Creon presents the most impressive arguments for his philosophy of government ends on a similar note of personal anxiety and defensiveness:\n",
