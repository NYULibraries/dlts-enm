            "pageText": "taken to a typical massage parlor in Bangkok, which did not look much different from the way massage parlors look in the 1990s.\nThere is an expensive look about the whole operation. Inside the entrance is a large department store display window. The walls are draped in red velvet. The glare of 30 spot-lights shows off the merchandise; nearly 200 girls, all pretty and painted and wearing bright colored dresses and platform shoes. They sit on tiers of benches, looking like an all-girl choir. I asked if any of them spoke English. A few were pointed out.\nAfter making his selection and paying the equivalent of $10, he was taken by the young woman to a small room.\nAfter the routine of the bath she started to take off her dress. I told her to keep it on and we spent the rest of the time talking.\nShe grew up on a farm northeast of Chiang Mai. When she was 16, an American came to the farm and told her parents he wanted her for his wife. He paid his gift of money and took her to an army base.\nShe thought the marriage was forever.

Now there are no more Americans to “marry” and she lives in the Village of Night Girls.40\nDuring the Vietnam War, “a highly organized U.S. R \u0026 R office in Bangkok had, in collaboration with a Thai general who ran a travel service, arranged for hotels costing no more than $5 a night.” These hotels were within a short walk of a “long string of massage parlors and big bars on new Petchburi Road.”41 The GI did not have to leave that road during his R \u0026 R leave. However, in another part of town, Patpong, construction workers, journalists, and other businessmen following and profiting from the war were doing business over drinks. Patpong, a more expensive, up-scale hangout for men, did not turn into the most active center for prostitution and sex tourism until the beginning of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1969 the first go-go bars opened in Patpong. Then “between 1973 and 1979 virtually all the street-level shops and offices on Patpong Road were replaced ",
