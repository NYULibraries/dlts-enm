            "pageText": "death or convulsions, however, did not indicate pain. People under anesthesia, after all, reported “delightful sensations” and “beatific visions.” Whatever pain might be involved was largely unfelt, according to the best medical evidence.17\nThis line of argument continued to receive considerable attention for over two decades. In 1901 a North American Review piece noted that morality would improve if death were no longer used as a threat, for its pain is in fact illusory. The Fortnightly Review contended more generally that with medical improvements, plus the new understanding that death need not be feared as painful, “death is disappearing from our thoughts.” “Perhaps the most distinctive note of the modern spirit is the practical disappearance of the thought of death as an influence directly bearing upon practical life.” Because death was losing its terrors—being now “regarded rather as a welcome friend than a grisly visitant”—and because beliefs in personal immortality were fading, the death of another “frequently causes more relief than grief to those who remain.” The article claimed that a host of new developments, including the tensions involved in medically prolonged life and the growing popularity of cremation, evidenced major changes in reactions toward death, particularly a decline in fear and sorrow. In 1909 Current Literature returned to the medical view, which reduced death’s terrors and emphasized gradual, rather peaceful decay. “We do not die suddenly; our existence perishes gradually with the weakening of the organs.” So, by implication, why a great fuss when the final stage occurred? By 1914 Living Age could refer in passing to virtual unanimity in the claim that “the ‘death agony’ is an unscientific conception,” which in turn meant that the whole atmosphere of death needed review. Current Literature attacked the idea that death or loss of consciousness should provoke fear; people should get used to the “hard facts of science” and stop emoting so much about what was in fact not only inevitable but also rather tranquil. Churches needed some other argument (if they could find one) to attract reasonable people back to attendance; death and grief were outdated religious motivations.18\nThese arguments about science reflected a desire to expose death to the cold light of reason and also to pick up on medical advances, including the growing emphasis on organic deterioration as the leading killer rather than epidemic or disease. The scientific approach included a number of idiosyncratic byways. Some commentators explained increases ",
