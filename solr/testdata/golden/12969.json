Cushing, “The Cushing Court and the Abolition of Slavery in Massachusetts: More Notes on the ‘Quock Walker Case,’” American Journal of Legal History 5 (April 1961): 118, 132-33 (printing for the first time what is evidently the final version of Cushing’s jury charge).\n83. Cover, Justice Accused, 44.\n84. See Cushing, “The Cushing Court and the Abolition of Slavery in Massachusetts,” 118-44; Grinnell, “The Anti-Slavery Decisions of 1781 and 1783,” 437-41; William O’Brien, “Did the Jennison Case Outlaw Slavery in Massachusetts?,” William and Mary Quarterly 17 (April 1960): 219-41; Spector, “The Quock Walker Cases (1781-83),” 12-32; Elaine MacEacheren, “Emancipation of Slavery in Massachusetts: A Reexamination, 1770-1790,” Journal of Negro History 55 (October 1970): 289-306; Arthur Zilversmit, “Quok Walker, Mum-bet, and the Abolition of Slavery in Massachusetts,” William and Mary Quarterly 25 (October 1968): 614-24.\n85. The status of slaves in transit and nonresident runaway slaves was not before the high court of Massachusetts in Cushing’s day. Those issues were addressed by Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw’s court in the nineteenth century. See Leonard W. Levy, The Law of the Commonwealth and Chief Justice Shaw (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1957), 59-108.\n86. See generally Saul Cornell, “Early American History in a Postmodern Age,” William and Mary Quarterly 50 (April 1993): 329-41.\n87. A story that is reported in the biographical accounts of Cushing’s life with almost as much frequency as the story about his making a list of materials he would need for a new suit is one about how Cushing was the last American judge to wear the full-bottomed English judicial wig.\n88. Marshall’s contributions are well summarized by Johnson: (1) establishing the “opinion of the Court” as the major vehicle for announcing the Court’s decisions; (2) insisting upon “collegial decorum” among the justices; and (3) encouraging the justices to share expertise, to work together for the good of the Court, and to be sensitive to the abilities and limitations of their brethren. Johnson, Speech to the Supreme Court Historical Society. See generally Herbert A. Johnson, The Chief Justiceship of John Marshall, 1801-1835 (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1997).\n\n\n",
