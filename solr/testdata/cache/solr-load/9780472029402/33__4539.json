It maximizes channel capacity and the speed of communication. But this use of information has a longer history, where information has repeatedly been used as a device to control conditions of overload. Indeed, the “information society” emerged, as communications scholar James Beniger argues, “in response to the nineteenth-century crisis of control.”39 The accelerated rates of production that arose with mechanized industry brought about a rising need to manage production, monitor supply and consumption, and coordinate distribution. Information and communication were central to establishing control over increased production and became strategies for coordinating and distributing goods and monitoring labor.40\nThe management of information involves the application of technologies that control yet contribute to the problem of proliferation. The threat of overload can give rise to adaptation and innovation, where new technologies are required to trawl through all the new data. In the loop from crisis of proliferation to crisis of control, excess data gives way to technologies for managing that excess.41 Electronics could be located in this loop, as technologies that, on one level, improved the efficiency of calculation and communication. Yet these technologies also operate as technologies of excess; they are the very devices through which we can trace emerging forms of proliferation. This is the dilemma of information, where the line between information and entropy is a thin one.42 Information technologies contribute to the very proliferation they attempt to manage.43\nThe flood of information is both a consequence of and contributor to the pervasiveness of electronics. From speculation about what could be achieved through widespread use of electronics in the 1960s, to the introduction of the first integrated circuit used in the pocket calculator in 1971, to the development and increasing use of home and office desktop computers in the 1980s, the proliferation of these devices arose parallel with new languages—and even philosophies—for analyzing electronic information. The pervasiveness of electronic technologies may even contribute, through sheer quantity, to changes in the movement and definition of knowledge. In language that could be read as symptomatic of its subject, Jean François Lyotard suggested in his government-commissioned study on information, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, that “the proliferation of information-processing machines” would contribute to changes in the “circulation of learning” and in what counts as “knowledge statements.”44 In Lyotard's assessment, the amount ",
