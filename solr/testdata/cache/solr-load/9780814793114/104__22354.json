Alcohol abuse led to a fracture of Charles’s arm, which led to serious pain and decreased mobility, which facilitated the development of pneumonia, which ultimately resulted in depression and problems with sleep. If the psychiatric provider had merely addressed Charles’s depression, sleep disturbance, alcohol abuse, and psychiatric medications, a serious infection would have gone untreated. As physicians, psychiatrists utilize a set of methods gleaned from basic science to understand the workings of the human body. These methods emphasize diagnosis, which determines appropriate treatment (Weissman, 1994). Identification and treatment of comorbid conditions can lead to increased level of function, decreased disability, and improved quality of life (Streim \u0026 Katz, 1995). Psychiatric facilitation of primary care for HIV patients may affect survival, given the association between survival and lack of medical care (Dorrell, Snow, \u0026 Ong, 1995), higher T-helper, also known as CD4, cell count at the initial visit (Hogg, Strathdee, Craib, O’Shaughnessy, Montaner, \u0026 Schecter, 1994), and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy (Osmond, Charlebois, Lang, Shiboski, \u0026 Moss, 1994).\nPsychiatrist as Consultant/Liaison\nPeter approached the nursing station asking for juice.

He rapidly earned the reputation of being “high maintenance” and “intrusive.” As the unit clerk was explaining who his nurse would be for that shift, Peter started to urinate in the hallway. Quickly, several staff members rushed to stop him. As they approached, he repeated his request for juice. He became agitated and hostile as staff returned him to his room. A psychiatric consult was requested to evaluate Peter’s behavior, which the staff perceived to occur when his demands were not immediately met.\nThe consulting psychiatrist interviewed Peter and found him to be pleasant and cooperative; he demonstrated problems recalling information and moved very slowly; Peter denied having symptoms of mood, anxiety, or psychotic illness. Upon meeting with the staff, the psychiatrist discovered that Peter was repeatedly instructed in the use of his call button as the preferred way of calling for nursing assistance but that Peter “refused” to comply with these instructions.
