            "pageText": "(“Queer Practices of the Negro Voodoo Doctors”) was typical in its diagnosis of the cultural import of “the colored race . . . patronizing ‘voodoo doctors’ and squandering money on ‘conjuring spells’”: “Civilization would appear to have little or no effect in deterring” these practices among the “negroes.”64 Primitiveness, in other words, is ahistorical; reform is for naught. Though often secular, such judgments were amenable to long-standing convictions regarding the inherent evil of African-derived spiritualities (especially voodoo and its assumed associations with cannibalism, child sacrifice, and ritual orgies), and in subsequent decades, this combination joined with American imperialist sentiment to provide a justification for the U.S. occupation of Haiti (1915–34).65 A 1920 New York Tribune article titled “The Evil Spell of the Voodoo Is over Hayti” gives a sense of the prevailing rhetoric, trumpeting the marines’ “task of subduing [the] barbaric sorcery” of voodoo, labeled “A Souvenir of Africa” and a “savage tribal custom.” “There remains but one thing to start the Haytian native on his upward course,” the article continues: “the industry which the white man can bring to this little republic.”66 Haitians are here at least granted the possibility of an “upward course” out of “barbari[sm],” but, as in the racist evolutionary historiographies discussed in chapter 2, it’s a paternalistic concession that assumes the white man’s supervision over the eradication of what an earlier article describes as “A Fragment of Darkest Africa on the Western Hemisphere.”67 As we shall see in the next chapter, Chesnutt, though renouncing the racial essentializations of this logic (he is careful to note that “relics of ancestral barbarism are found among all peoples”), largely shares the conviction that conjure and related practices are pernicious “superstition[s]” that need to be relinquished for black Americans to assume their proper place within “advanced civilization.”68\n        By 1930, however, a marked shift had occurred in at least some people’s attitudes toward voodoo. Against the backdrop of the Harlem Renaissance and increasing anti-imperialist sentiment, diasporic spirituality in general and voodoo in particular became objects of sincere religious, anthropological, and/or aesthetic inquiry for black and white persons alike.69 Melville J. Herskovits’s 1932 Boasian ethnography, Life in a Haitian Valley, for example, presented voodoo as a ",
