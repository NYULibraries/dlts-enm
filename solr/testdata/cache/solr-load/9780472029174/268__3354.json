            "pageText": "\nContemporary Art Institute of Detroit\nThe Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit was founded in 1979 by Detroit-based artists Charles McGee and Jean Hielbrunn. Its founding was a response to Detroit's condition as a place where contemporary art was intensively produced, but also where public venues for exhibiting this art were lacking. While the institutionalization of art often implies a stifling of creativity, initiative and vision, the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit assayed a critical institutionalization, a deployment of institutionality against the grain by a self-organized artists' collective dedicated to the production of new connections between art and community.\nFor its first twenty-five years of existence, the Institute functioned nomadically, organizing and curating exhibitions and installations at a series of public sites throughout Detroit. In 2004, the Institute took over a building that was occupied by Detroit Contemporary, a gallery in operation from 1998 to 2003 that was co-founded by artists Aaron Timlin and Phaedra Robinson, founder of the Center for Creative eXchange.\n",
