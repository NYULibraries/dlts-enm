See Alex Dragnich, “The Anatomy of a Myth: Serbian Hegemony,” Slavic Review 50, no. 3 (fall 1991): 559–662; for a rebuttal of Dragnich’s thesis, see James J. Sadkovich, “Serbian Hegemony Revisited, or Blaming the Perpetrator, not the Victim,” Association of Croatian Studies Bulletin, October 1991.\n31. See Briggs, op. cit., 977–86; and Ian Brownlie, Basic Documents in International Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), 4, 14–17. Claims that the country was involved in “civil war” effectively protected Belgrade from sanctions for attacking a sovereign state.\n32. Warren Christopher warned during an interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer News hour on April 5, 1993, that military intervention would mean an end to humanitarian aid and more killing and bloodshed. Less disingenuously, he added that Russia was “very reluctant” to lift the arms embargo, but did not say whether Moscow considered Belgrade its client. In an interview on the same show in March 1993, David Owen insisted that the Serbs must be offered a “carrot” in addition to being shown the “stick,” so that they would talk peace and the Russians would “stay on board.” More recently, Elizabeth Furse warned on the April 18, 1994, broadcast that “more people will get killed” if the arms embargo is lifted.\n33. Kissinger solemnly informed Koppel’s listeners that “these people have been fighting for a thousand years,” on ABC’s Nightline, April 22, 1993; the Nation depicted Croatia’s government as “crypto-fascist” in “Bosnian Quandary,” April 26, 1993; William Pfaff, “Reflections (The Absence of Empire),” New Yorker, August 10, 1992, argued that the peace settlements after World War I and Tito’s regime after World War II had “denied” Serbs the opportunity to create an “integral Greater Serbia”; Aleksa Djilas, The Contested Country: Yugoslav Unity and Communist Revolution, 1919–1953 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991), 43–47, 225, focused on Croatian atrocities while excusing those committed by Serbs during the war; and Robert M. Hayden, “Constitutional Nationalism in Formerly Yugoslav Republics,” Slavic Review 51, no. 4 (1992), has implied that Croatia’s president is responsible for Serbian atrocities. It is thus not surprising that John F. Burns, Stephen Engelberg, Chuck Sudetic, and Celestine Bohlen all got their history wrong and that American leaders did as well. See, for example, articles by the latter three in the New York Times, March 24, April 2, and May 16, 1991.\n34. Typical was a National Public Radio report on November 29, 1993, that noted that Jews in Croatia were worried over the “quiet rehabilitation” of the NDH, the World War II Croatian state; and Col. Miguel Moreno’s remark on an April 6, 1993, ABC Nightline segment that if Serbian areas had been cleansed of ",
