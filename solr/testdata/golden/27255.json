Gloria Wade-Gayles states that in black communities, “praise for our mothers is the refrain of church songs, the text of sermons, and the subject of wise sayings passed from one generation of Black women to another.”9 Earl Shorris10 claims that in Latino cultures, motherhood is honored and respected and associated with strength, perseverance, and patience. African American as well as Latino adolescents are likely conveying messages (to their interviewers) and living the lessons about mothers that they have absorbed from their respective communities. The valuing of mothers may also stem from the adolescents’ socioeconomic circumstances. As part of a social class where living a comfortable and healthy life is not taken for granted, the person who makes such a life possible (at least during adolescence) will clearly be important. For these adolescents, their mothers have not simply raised them, they have made it possible for them to live.\nAnother plausible reason for these adolescents’ strong feelings toward their mothers may lie with the problems many of them had in maintaining close friendships with their peers. As a result of their lack of intimate and trusting friendships, their mothers may be the only ones whom they can really trust or who will “be there” for them. Strikingly, the two boys who rarely mentioned having difficulties trusting their peers were the two whose mothers had died when they were young. Without mothers, these two boys may have been more motivated to establish close peer relationships. Or perhaps these two boys did not have a trusting and loyal relationship at home with which to compare their friendships.\nNotably, the adolescents who spoke about the importance of their mothers were better off academically and more socially integrated than those who felt less passionately about them. These teens were typically on the honor rolls, in extracurricular activities, and were not involved in highrisk activities. Their relationships with their mothers may be a critical factor in their resilience. However for those few adolescents who felt passionately about their mothers and who struggled in school, their deeply connected relationship with their mothers may explain why, for example, they still remain in school.\nAs these adolescents described themselves, their role models, their futures, their values, their school, and their lives, I was able to hear—both in form and in content—the importance of their mothers in their lives.
