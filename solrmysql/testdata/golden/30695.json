A knife has to be carefully modulated in practice. Carving must be done with a moderate “appetyte,” not rashly or haphazardly, as one uses a knife elsewhere, as in the field.136 Such composure is supposed to signal human superiority over the technical instruments and the relevant taskscape. But the kinesthetics of dining at the table has an unpredictable element, and moreover, as I have been emphasizing, appetite suppression is always problematic, requiring an improper relationship to the animal body in the name of impersonal propriety. Other kinds of tortured behavior cannot be far behind, as seen in some extreme literary examples. People are repeatedly betrayed, tricked, and killed by the knife’s edge and served at the table. In his Fall of Princes, Lydgate relates the legend of Artreus, in which he is said to have slain Thiestes’s children, bled their throats, carved and roasted their parts, and “served hem atte table,” and the ordinary idiom intensifies the shock and spectacle. Similarly, in another place, we read that Astryages murders and makes a meal of the son of Harpagus:\n        \n          The sone was slayn of Arpagus the kyng,\n          And afftir rosted, allas, ful causeles,\n          And sithe [then] presentid, amongis al the pres [company],\n          Toforn [Before] his fader, a thyng most lamentable,\n          With Astriages as he sat at table.\n        \n        Elsewhere, a tyrannical father dismembers his son and delivers small pieces of familial flesh to the unsuspecting mother.137 The hardware associated with dressing and eating animals is converted for the purposes of wicked cannibalistic acts, where the subject—usually the child— becomes one among other edibles. The table is often a scene of extreme ",
