            "pageText": "Chemistry and Advice\nThe Clinton presidency is in many ways a remarkably personal one. People are crucially important to Clinton. According to Elizabeth Drew, Clinton is “recharged by contact with the public” and has “almost a mystical sense of his relationship with ‘the people,’” (1994, 95). There is no question that Clinton has dropped many of the protective walls surrounding the presidency in an effort to establish a close personal relationship with the public. As a result, he has often revealed more of himself than the public necessarily wanted to know (such as his revelation, during an appearance on MTV, that he wore boxers, not briefs).\nSimilarly, Clinton feels the need to provide a running commentary on his own presidency. This stems in part from his belief that he has to bypass the press because he cannot count on their good will. It also reflects his strong personal belief that he can convince anyone of his good intentions and the advantages of his positions, if he can just speak with them directly. Prior to his first meeting with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, Clinton informed Al Gore that he wanted to meet Greenspan alone, to establish “one-to-one chemistry” (Woodward 1994, 68).\nChemistry, of course, weighs very heavily in Clinton’s calculation; he must feel personally comfortable with others in his administration and those he appoints to other important positions.2\nWhen Clinton interviewed Alice Rivlin for the budget director post, he “made it clear to his aides that he found her prickly and lacking the easy warmth and humor that he liked” (Woodward 1994, 114). Both Bill and Hillary “have a greater need than is good for them to have people around them whose loyalty—and lack of independence—wasn’t in question” (Drew 1994, 235).3 When it came to selecting his first chief of staff, “Friend after friend of Clinton said Clinton didn’t want a Jim Baker (Reagan’s strong, and cunning Chief of Staff). He wanted someone with whom he was utterly comfortable, whom he could completely trust, who had no agenda of his own, and who wouldn’t get in his way” because, “to his own great detriment, Clinton wanted to be his own Chief of Staff” (Drew 1994, 130).4\nClinton’s selection of advisers on the basis of “chemistry” (which can be translated as “they get along with me and I with them”) runs the risk of giving too much weight to concurrence, in the decision process. By all accounts, President Clinton dominates his domestic policy staff meetings. He has “surrounded himself with deferential advisers who are either without national experience or much younger” (Blumenthal 1993b, 37).5 Drew ",
