Nevertheless, we must protect ourselves from any further blood dilution.\nIt would seem that the minister of justice was motivated by this defensive obligation when he specified his objection to recognizing the Christianity of certain converts for the purposes of the definition in the bill under consideration.157\nThe joint subcommittee adopted the final version of the bill on June 23, 1941, and after its confirmation in the legislature it was published officially on August 8, 1941.\nThe material cited above indicates that the differences between the stand adopted by the churches and that of the government were limited to certain groups of converts. The areas of disagreement between the two sides were restricted to details of secondary importance. On the other hand, government and church held similar views on the principles that were the basis of the legislation. Both sides expressed their sorrow at the mistake that had occurred when the Jewish religion was granted full recognition in 1895, and proclaimed the purifying influence of Christianity in contrast to Judaism. The style affected by the church leaders in their speeches was no less abrupt and insulting to the Jews than the style of the secular government representatives. When the leaders of the priesthood stood up to defend the status and Christianity of the converts, they expressed their fear of “the degeneration” of the latter back to Judaism. The chairman of the Neologic Jewish community in Budapest spoke up against the insult directed at Jews and Judaism by these expressions: “as if Jewry, the Jewish religion, which was both the first to declare monotheism and was the cradle of Christianity, is of such a low category that adherence to it implies regression.”158\nWhile the debate on the bill was going on and after the bill was adopted, the expression “fajgyalazas” (shaming the race) was adopted by wide circles in Hungary. The expression was not a new one, especially since the Nuremberg legislation, which included the phrase “Rassenschande”—but after the Hungarian legislation it was commonly used by all. According to the legal definition, any sexual connection between a Jew and a Christian woman—except for prostitutes—was considered “shaming the race.” The expression rapidly made its way to articles in the press, speeches, and popular antisemitic songs, alongside other expressions referring to the occupations the “Jewboys” enjoyed, such as evading taxation, spreading false, evil rumors, etc. These songs were sung by wide circles on many occasions, and in this way the concept came to enjoy wide popularity and distribution.\n",
