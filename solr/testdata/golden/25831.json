The former dismissed the debate as trivial; the latter was a plea for tolerance.\nBut a self-conscious and political bisexual voice did begin appearing in Lesbian Contradiction in 1990, after Murphy’s views were aired once again in “The Gay-Straight Split Revisited.” Dajenya deplored the tendency of oppressed groups to argue over who’s more oppressed, rejected the accusation that as a bisexual she was “consorting with the enemy,” and presented her bisexuality as a source of political awareness and action.34 In the same issue, Jane Litwoman wrote that “gender is just not what I care about,” and analyzed the sources of her privilege and oppression as a person who, in this “gender-fetishic culture,” is usually labeled “bisexual.”35 Three years later, Alena Smith wrote about her ability to enjoy making love with both genders, and rejected the stereotypes that as a bisexual woman she was “going through a phase” or avoiding serious relationships.36 Although self-consciously bisexual voices appeared in Lesbian Contradiction two years earlier than they did in Out/Look, they were individual voices that spoke of the personal, sometimes in political terms but largely in reaction to lesbians’ criticisms of bisexuality; there was little evidence of the growing bisexual community with issues and interests of its own. In Lesbian Contradiction, the “bisexual issue” is still a “lesbian controversy.”\nIn summary, different lesbian and/or gay publications present the issue of bisexuality differently, and some, like 10 Percent, don’t present it as an issue at all. In the mainstream and traditionally male-dominated pages of The Advocate, bisexuality is merely a topic for conversation. Bisexuals came into existence when The Advocate wasn’t looking and when bisexuals wrote to The Advocate to announce themselves, The Advocate duly reported their existence and then went on with business as usual. Insofar as bisexuality is an issue, the issue is bisexual inclusion and the predominant liberal humanist opinion favors inclusion. In contrast, in the Lesbian and Gay Community represented by Out/Look, bisexuality is a controversial issue. Lesbian feminist concerns about bisexuality were serious, but they belonged to an earlier era and their merit is fading as the lesbian and gay mainstream returns to its humanist origins. The bisexual movement is the wave of the future. Bisexuals not ",
