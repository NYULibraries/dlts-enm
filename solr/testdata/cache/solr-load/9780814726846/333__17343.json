Howe, supra note 1, at 6 (Williams sought to erect a wall of separation to protect religion); Hall, supra note 1, at 481–82 (disagreeing with Howe, Hall argues that Williams sought to protect both religion and the state).\n63. See Cohen, supra note 1, at 16, 18; Jaher, supra note 1, at 94, 109–10; cf. Cohen, supra note 1, at 16–17 (on antisemitism against a “mythical Jew”). Marcus and Sachar both note that other isolated Jews preceded this group in New Netherlands. See Marcus, supra note 35, at 215–16; Sachar, supra note 35, at 13.\n61. Peter Stuyvesant, Petition to Expel the Jews from New Amsterdam (1654), reprinted in The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History 357 (Paul R. Mendes-Flohr \u0026 Jehuda Reinharz eds., 1980).\n61. See Dutch West India Company, Reply to Stuyvesant’s Petition (1655), reprinted in The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History 358 (Paul R. Mendes-Flohr \u0026 Jehuda Reinharz eds., 1980); Sachar, supra note 35, at 14. Marcus notes that although very few Jews were stockholders in the Company, the Company was nearly bankrupt and needed all of the support and good will that it could muster. Marcus, supra note 35, at 220. In subsequent correspondence, though, the Company referred to Judaism as an “abominable religion.” Dutch West India Company, Rights of the Jews of New Amsterdam (1656), reprinted in The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History 358, 359 (Paul R. Mendes-Flohr \u0026 Jehuda Reinharz eds., 1980).\nJews in New Netherland faced additional difficulties. For example, the sale of a house from a Christian to a Jew was disallowed “for pregnant reasons.” See Petition to Keep a House Bought at Auction (Dec. 17, 1655) (denied, Dec. 23, 1655), reprinted in Schappes, supra note 35, at 8, 9. Conditions improved slightly when the English took control of New York in 1664, but by that time, almost all of the original Jewish settlers had left. See Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews 278–79 (1987); Sachar, supra note 35, at 15–17.\n66. Cohen, supra note 1, at 3; see id. at 18; Jaher, supra note 1, at 96; Marcus, supra note 35, at 229–30.\n67. See The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina (1669), reprinted in 2 Poore, supra note 1, at 1397, 1406 [hereinafter Fundamental Constitutions]; Cohen, supra note 1, at 17.\n68. Fundamental Constitutions, supra note 67, at 1406–07. I must note that for Locke to seek to advise Jews of “the peaceableness and inoffensiveness” of Christians seems a cruel joke after the centuries of antisemitic persecution, both before and after the Reformation.\n69. See Ahlstrom, supra note 1, at 109.\n70. Maryland Toleration Act (Apr. 21, 1649), reprinted in 1 Commager, supra note 1, at 31, 31.\n71. See The Indictment of Dr. Jacob Lumbrozo in Maryland (Feb. 23, 1658), reprinted in Schappes, supra note 35, at 13; Cohen, supra note 1, at 16; Jaher, supra note 1, at 88; Marcus, supra note 35, at 449–50; Sachar, supra note 35, at 19.\n72. Butler, supra note 1, at 38; see Miller, New England Mind, supra note 1, at 15; Vaughan, supra note 1, at 298.\n73. See Butler, supra note 1, at 62–63. Not all historians agree that New England Puritanism went through a period of decline. See Vaughan, supra note 1, at 297.\n74. Miller, New England Mind, supra note 1, at 95; see Emerson, supra note 1, at 85–88. Jon Butler writes:\nThe Half-Way Covenant of 1662 confirmed new, complex, and incomplete church membership patterns. Some residents were “full” church members who had “owned the covenant” by testifying to God’s work in their lives; some were baptized adults who had not yet owned the covenant and therefore were “half-way” members; and some were unbaptized sons and daughters of the baptized “half-way” members.\nButler, supra note 1, at 60.\n75. Ahlstrom, supra note 1, at 124; see id. at 124 n.l.\n76. Jaher, supra note 1, at 107 (quoting Johannes Wollebious, The Abridgement of Christian Divinitie 24, 59, 231 (Alexander Ross trans., 2d ed. London: John Saywell 1656)).\n77. Miller, Errand, supra note 1, at 151.\n78. See id.; Miller \u0026 Johnson, supra note 1, at 193–94.\n79.
