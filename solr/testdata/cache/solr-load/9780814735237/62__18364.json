Lacking legal protection, the undocumenteds benefit employers seeking a means of lowering wages and avoiding unions.\nMorales’s study raises the question whether undocumented workers—whose labor allows some manufacturers to delay automation and remain competitive—do cause some union and wage erosion. However, they may also make it possible for some industries to survive in the United States, thereby protecting some jobs for natives. Immigration restrictions would not necessarily make it possible for unions to maintain jobs and wages at high levels as the threat of industry relocation to countries with cheaper labor would remain.\n(iii) Electronics\nA comprehensive study of electronics companies in Southern California found that more than a third of the jobs involved low-wage assembly, more than a third of the workers were immigrants, about two-thirds were women, and the ratio of African American workers to Latinos was 1 to 14.5. Consistent with findings in Chicago, the demographic makeup of the workforce seemed to reflect employer preferences for Latino workers who were regarded as more “diligent,” “hardworking,” and “loyal” than native workers (including African Americans), who were more aware of their rights.38\nThe focus on Southern California is important. The Department of Labor notes that in 1980 electronics production constituted 60 percent of all manufacturing jobs in the state. And while Silicon Valley in Northern California is known for its electronics industry, production facilities in the 1980s moved south to counties such as Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego, which now represent the nation’s largest concentration of electronics firms. A third of the small firms and half of the large companies decided to locate in Southern California because of the region’s labor supply, which, of course, is noted for its immigrant population.\nFor reasons of competitiveness, electronics firms resort to subcontracting, which in turn depends on a malleable workforce. Subcontracting allows smaller firms to handle technical functions such as design, and larger ones to complete basic production without having to maintain a large permanent workforce. For small firms, subcontracting ",
