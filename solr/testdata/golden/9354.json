What were you doing in the Sinai?” I gave them my story, but they refused to accept it. Disbelieving me, they put pressure on me to produce another story. It was tough. I used to tell myself that I had fallen into a deep, dark pit, but every passing day, every interrogation, was like going one step up, out of the pit. And so it went on and on. After each of my operations, I would find all these interrogators, like birds of prey surrounding a dying animal, around my bed. They never let me be at peace.\nThey continued with their pressure. They wouldn’t let me sleep, deprived me of food for a number of days, and beat me on the head. To this very day my ears buzz from their treatment. They used to kick me and shake the bed, causing agonizing pain in my broken legs. Once they entered the room with an axe and threatened to amputate my leg…. I didn’t believe they would be that cruel. Their questions were repeated again and again, because they couldn’t report to their commanders with the kind of evasive answers I had been giving them. Usually I was interrogated by two men, with a Palestinian interpreter. The interrogations scared me to death, yet I knew I shouldn’t let them realize this.

The moving of chairs toward my bed was enough to frighten me badly.\nI suppose that the interpreter had an additional role in the team. One day, after the interrogators had left the room, he told me, “Listen, you must talk, or it will be much worse for you; you will be taken away.” He said that he had come from Jaffa and knew the Egyptians very well. I answered naively that he didn’t understand the immense hatred the Egyptians felt toward the Palestinians, and that only with us, the Israelis, did they stand a chance of living in peace. He went excitedly out of the room and returned with the interrogators who screamed, “Snake! How dare you speak like that to your interrogators!” I had just added oil to the fire.\nI found out that they knew a great deal about the IDF. More than I or any average officer did. They expected me to be acquainted with details about this camp or that camp, to identify ",
