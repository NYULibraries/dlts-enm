Her chaingun did 9–15 damage, but in a three-pellet burst for a total of 9–45 damage and at a rate of over 450 shots per minute (or around 7 shots per second). In contrast to the Cyberdemon, this was hitscan damage, so if you were in her line of fire, you were in serious trouble. Unlike the Cyberdemon, who could be tackled with a solid stream of strafing and firing, the best tactic when faced with the Spiderdemon was to loop around behind her, moving each time she tried to turn to face you. Perhaps it was this natural tactical means of defeating her that made her less rewarding as a final boss. If you were good, being able to dodge the Cyberdemon's rockets meant that you could take him on face-to-face. Since the Spiderdemon was using a hitscan attack, it made more sense to get around where you couldn't be targeted. It's hard to feel as heroic shooting someone in the back, even if it is a fifty-foot-tall demonic robot spider.\nIt's certainly an interesting case study in agent design that the type of targeting used has an effect on player behavior, which, in turn, needs to be factored into the reward system on offer. In terms of the contrast between the two boss fights, the Cyberdemon was certainly tougher, with an extra 1,000 hit points; did more damage on a direct hit; and, critically, had a lower pain threshold (meaning there was less chance of “stunning” it to force a break in its firing for a few tics). It was also a smaller target. This last point is interesting given what we've learned about the strange firing mode of the BFG9000, as it means that a player who can get in close to the Spiderdemon can potentially land on her a large percentage of the secondary fire from the hitscan attacks (given that, at close range and a width of 256 units, a substantial part of the cone of fire will be taken up by her body), dispatching her in just a few shots. All in all, although the Spiderdemon is obviously a tough cookie, the interesting thing is that her weaknesses compound exponentially for the more experienced, skilled player. So this boss is not just intrinsically weaker than the Cyberdemon (although this is clearly true), but the types of tactical combat skills a strong DOOM player was likely to use are exactly those most likely to amplify these weaknesses.\nIn any case, sooner or later, that last missile, cell, bullet, or fist strikes home, and we are rewarded with brain gib on an epic scale, as the metal legs give way, the cortex of all evil goes up in a cloud of beefy chunklets, and we nosedive into the final text. Oh wait. Hang on. There actually is a cut-scene of sorts.\n\n\n\n",
