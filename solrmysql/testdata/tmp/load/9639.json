The celebration of Passover, the holiday of freedom marking the exodus of the ancient Jews from Egypt, obtained tremendous ritualistic significance in jail. The men had to overcome their differences of background and education to find a common way to celebrate, face the challenge of preparing the holiday meal and ritual under these difficult conditions, and then convince the prison authorities to invite guests, among them a rabbi from Cairo and several military officers. The concrete and symbolic achievements involved in this celebration empowered the men for a long period, and were recounted and reinterpreted with great enthusiasm during our interviews many years later.\nNo less significant was their joint translation of Tolkien’s Hob-bit, a book which appeared in press in Hebrew after the men’s return (Tolkien 1977) and contributed to the notoriety of the group. The initial motive for the translation was to share the pleasure of reading it with those prisoners who could not read it in English. The four pilots fluent in English concentrated on the effort for several months, and the others participated by giving feedback and copying the manuscript. It is probably not a coincidence that the climax of the men’s productive work focused on this specific book. The Hobbit presents an imaginary plot about a brave, peace-loving creature who lives in an underground world and fights the dragon who had taken away the hobbits’ kingdom. At the end, the victorious hobbit returns to his land and home to write his memoirs. Obviously this tale was loaded with meaningful associations for the captives; it provided a mythical narrative account, with a happy ending, of their life in captivity. The issues of good against evil, and the personality of the antihero who stands for friendship, loyalty, love, tolerance, and nobility, could not but charm those who had become victims of war and violence and were fighting for their own freedom.\n",
