Given unanimity, no one will be able to coerce any particular outcome from others. The productively weak, therefore, will not be able to coerce the productively strong into guaranteeing that social minimum they no doubt may want but which there seems to be no reason to concede. The social agreement must instead be that people may utilize their productive powers as they judge best. If they judge that some of their output should go, gratis, to the otherwise poor, so be it. If not, it is difficult to see what recourse those otherwise poor could have, at the very least unless we allow coercion.\nSuppose that we do permit coercion at the outset. That is the defining feature of Hobbes’s State of Nature: Since there are no rules, literally nothing is forbidden, and therefore coercion in particular is not. As Hobbes conceives it, it is the permissibility of coercion that causes the problems inherent in that condition. Everybody loses—both the weak and the strong—because human powers are sufficiently equally distributed that no one can gain an advantage if all are able to use their powers without restraint.\nGray’s proposal would call for measures to be taken to see to it that everyone has a minimal stock of capital over and above the stock of “capital” inherent in one’s person by virtue of being a (more or less normal) human being, that is, one’s inherent repertoire of capabilities. But how are these measures to be conceived? There would seem only two options: either they are voluntary, or they are exacted coercively. The former resolves, in turn, into two possibilities: either such a social guarantee is held to be literally in the interest of each individual, or it is conceived as stemming from such things as sympathy or possibly an innate moral sense that one should share. Now, the latter conjectures are dicey if the claim is that all humans have the necessary measure of sympathy or benevolence toward all others. It is surely far more plausible to restrict the likely operation of any innate sympathy to narrower classes of persons such as parents and kin—and even there, as we have witnessed throughout history, cases typified by that of Cain and Abel crop up along with all the cases more favorable to the hypothesis. If the moral version is taken, then one has simply dissented from ",
