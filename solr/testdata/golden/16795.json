Interference with any individual’s right to liberty can never be legitimate given a proper definition of his purely private sphere. By contrast, a permission is merely a claim that is derived from the absence of any moral obligation on the part of the agent to refrain from competing with others, who similarly have no moral obligations to refrain from competition. Society may legitimately revoke any permission whenever to do so seems generally expedient:\nRestrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint qua restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain; and are wrong solely because they do not really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. . . . [L]eaving people to themselves is always better, ceteris paribus, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable.49\nEconomic freedom is a matter of general expedience rather than justice and moral right. If, as Mill thinks, purely private spheres can be identified where the agent’s conduct does not directly injure others, then equal rights to liberty can be assigned in harmony to all agents with respect to their private spheres. But economic transactions do not belong in private spheres. Any agent’s transactions inevitably affect the plans of others whether they like it or not, by influencing prices. Precisely because of interdependence among competitors for scarce resources, it is generally not feasible to give every agent an equal moral right to set prices as he likes. Agents must bargain for a common price at which to carry out their transactions, not claim that everyone else has a moral duty to accept some arbitrary price. Indeed, the idea that any agent has a right to set prices lacks appeal because liberty in this context is inseparable from power over others.\nUnequal bargaining power among agents plays a significant role in the real-world exchange for at least two reasons. First, when competitive markets fail, pursuit of efficiency can call for non-market institutions, large corporations and government, to ",
