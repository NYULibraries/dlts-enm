A leader with DBS, whose family has lived in Dharavi for four generations, expressed the general concern held by most of the opponents. “In Dharavi, the poor people are suffering. But government doesn’t want to solve that. . . . The actual motivation is to take the highly valuable land. They don’t want to help the people.”16 Organized now as an opposition movement, the activists were better placed to ensure that the benefits of redevelopment remained in Dharavi.\n      Co-Opting the Opposition\n      When I arrived in Mumbai to begin fieldwork in September 2005, the opposition movement that had seemed strong a year before had all but disappeared. Khandare had stopped publishing his community newspaper, and the city’s housing activists had moved on to other concerns. Over the next several months, I came to recognize that two factors explained the movement’s dormancy: project delays and the relatively successful co-optation of project opponents. Because there had been no significant activity on the project since the state had endorsed it in January 2004, many residents and opponents had grown skeptical that it would ever be implemented. When I asked project critics about the now dormant movement, some responded by asking why they should actively oppose a scheme that may exist only on paper.17 When developer interest was invited in June 2007 and it was clear the project was moving forward, the opposition movement was quickly revived. The movement’s dormancy was also an outcome of a tactical change adopted by Mehta and the SRA. Recognizing that participatory rhetoric had been insufficient to secure community support and prevent a visible and politically harmful opposition movement from arising, the state began a series of more substantive negotiations with potential opponents. These negotiations, it is clear, cannot be interpreted as mere rhetoric, but constitute meaningful—although certainly imbalanced—engagement of Dharavi residents as citizens.\n      In late 2004 Mehta recognized the need to respond to the protestors and work to build support within Dharavi. He began meeting directly with representatives from PROUD and requested meetings with the scheme’s most vocal opponents. Although Ramesh Khandare and Priya Shah refused to meet with him at the time, PROUD’s leadership was more willing to discuss ways they could be involved in the planning process. The willingness of PROUD to negotiate with Mehta created a split in the opposition movement. A project opponent once explained to me that ",
