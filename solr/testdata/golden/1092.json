As Pokémon and Hello Kitty invaded U.S. TV screens and supermarket aisles at a time when, paradoxically, Japanese economic influence was on the decline, U.S. scholars (and a good number of Japanese officials) started to point to the emergence of a new kind of Japanese superpower. The discussion shifted from Japan’s Gross National Product to its “Gross National Cool” (McGray, 2002). The characters in Japanese animated cartoon series (animation or anime) and in the related genre of manga (Japanese-style comic books or graphic novels), along with their videogame cousins, came to symbolize a new order in millennial capitalism characterized by a decline in U.S. cultural hegemony and the fragmentation of global powers (Allison, 2006). Thus, Japanese animation provides a logical starting point to an analysis aimed at decentralizing the role of the United States as the world’s most significant global cultural producer.\nThis chapter will demonstrate, however, that while intending to point to Japan’s growing influence and to a concomitant relative decline in U.S. power,\n",
