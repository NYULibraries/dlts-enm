These interests gained voice in late 2003, in a report commissioned by a policy organization named Bombay First. The report, referred to as the “McKinsey Report” for the international consulting firm commissioned to prepare it, did not reveal new findings or present novel policy proposals for improving the city’s competitive position. Rather, the glossy thirty-page report voiced anxieties that the business community had felt for years and made familiar recommendations for improving the city’s economic position and quality of life. The report suggested that Mumbai could make “jumps toward achieving world city status” within ten to fifteen years if a variety of development projects were undertaken, including improved transportation infrastructures, deregulation of the city’s land supply, and the construction of new housing (Bombay First 2003). Given the congruence between Mehta’s Dharavi plan and the recommendations outlined in the McKinsey Report, the state government eventually adopted and promoted the two plans side by side.\n      In the mid-1990s, members of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) formed a new organization to press for economic development objectives. Modeling itself on London First, a similar effort launched by London’s business community to address that city’s declining competitive position, the BCCI created Bombay First in 1996. As the former director of Mumbai First explained:\n      \n        People felt the business was going away, out of Mumbai. There was not much business coming into the city. It was moving to Hyderabad, to Bangalore. . . . It was learned that Mumbai was going down in two major ways. One was that economic growth in the city was going down. And secondly, economic growth was reducing the quality of life in the city. So in order to bring Mumbai back onto the business map of the country, several models were looked into. The New York model was looked into. And London was looked at too. It was going down twenty years ago, when the organization London First had emerged. And we picked up the London First model and we became Bombay First.16\n      \n      Representatives of most of the large foreign and domestic companies with headquarters or offices in Mumbai joined the effort. Upon its formation, Bombay First began lobbying the newly elected Shiv Sena–BJP government to support reforms and make investments. With the new administration ",
