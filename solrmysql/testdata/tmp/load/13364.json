The vein he’d hit formed a bubble like a tire about to blow, and as they all watched—it took no more than a second or two—the knot of vein expanded just beneath the skin and then burst sending a thin jet of blood three feet up the wall.\n“Whack, bim, pop,” Ratface canted in triumph. “You cannot cook reds.”\nElvin let out a cry. He appeared to go into shock.\n“Goddamn,” he told them, “someone get a towel,” but was already pushing away from the table himself. His wig loosened violently to one side and he hurried bentwaist toward the kitchen with the queer shuffling gait of a fat man, finger pressed to the crook of his arm as if protecting it from sight.\nRatface was smirking to himself. The other man just looked at the wall and blinked. Although this man was not wearing the same gray workshirt with his name stitched above its pocket, and his hair appeared to be combed in an entirely new way, Holgate had recognized him from the card game they’d robbed just the week before.\nVic.\nRight. The one with the twenty-five hundred dollars.\n",
