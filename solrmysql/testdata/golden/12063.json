We shall support our army with our entire economic effort and with our entire capability. I have already declared that we have come into this war because of ideals, because the Hungarian people fight against Bolshevism with all their might. We must take part in this struggle with all our strength because this war will decide the fate of our nation—survival or cessation. And so once again I beg of you: starting today, starting now, please view this subject as the most central and most important problem of our country and of all our actions.\nAnother central topic in Kallay’s speech was the expropriation of the estates belonging to Jews:\nThe ministry of agriculture is involved in all kinds of problems, but with your permission, I will not deal with them at present…. I assume you read today in the official newspaper that all the estates of more than 500 hold belonging to Jews are, from today, in a state of deep freeze. This deep freeze includes all their equipment, both their living equipment, i.e., the animals, and their inert equipment…. We have no intention of carrying out the expropriation of the estates by word of mouth or by all kinds of biological definitions. The proposed legislation will be carried out on the basis of the law for the Protection of the Race, and it is obvious that the legislation hereby proposed will not recognize all the exemptions which were granted to certain Jews within the framework of the second anti-Jewish law.\nIncidentally, I must also announce that I have confiscated all the forests which were in the hands of Jews. We are talking of more than half a million hold of forests—in addition to all the other estates, whose combined area itself comes to more than half a million hold…. We shall expropriate all the lands in return for bonds, we shall not pay cash for the expropriated estates. The prime minister also mentioned the role of the minister of justice, “who will, in the most immediate future, present a bill for the expropriation of the estates of the Jews.”\nKallay also referred to Jewry in general:\nI shall not discuss the Jewish problem in order to clarify the question of whether Jewry is a race or not. I am of the opinion that we have already passed this stage, and that it has been clearly demonstrated that Jewry is indeed a race…. This is natural and self-explanatory, and I am unable to think of Jewry in any other terms than as a race.179\nThe first speaker after Kallay was the chairman of his party:\nHungarian policy has been based for the past decade on the idea of protecting the race, on the ideas of Christianity and nationalism known as “the Szeged idea.” …. The various governments recognized the unique justice ",
