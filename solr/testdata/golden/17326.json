XX, § 2.\n120. See Forrester, supra note 37, at 328.\n121. See Hancock, supra note 78, at 98–99, 108–09, 133. As Ralph Hancock notes, “Calvin is very much concerned to ground human institutions by establishing the political order as part of the divine order.” Id. at 34. Hancock emphasizes that Calvin rejected the effectiveness of classical reason in the natural world. Classical (or natural) reason was significant to Catholicism because of Aristotle’s influence on Thomas. Moreover, Hancock argues that Calvin’s reform theology has much in common with modern rationalism. Unlike classical (or natural) reason, modern rationalism views the world as bereft of purpose and substance. See, e.g., id. at 20.\n122. Calvin, Institutes, supra note 78, at bk. 4, ch. XX, § § 6, 10.\n123. See Hancock, supra note 78, at 25–35.\n124.

See Skinner II, supra note 35, at 20, 81–89, 189–91.\n126. See Religious Peace of Augsburg (Sept. 25, 1555), reprinted in Church and State Through the Centuries: A Collection of Historic Documents With Commentaries 164 (Sidney Z. Ehler \u0026 John B. Morrall trans. \u0026 eds., 1954) [hereinafter Ehler].\n127. I draw most of the information regarding the Huguenots and the French religious wars from Skinner II, supra note 35, at 242–55, 332–39; Walker, supra note 57, at 380–85; Columbia, supra note 1, at 564–66.\n128. Catherine was the virtual ruler of France for two decades after the death of Henry II in 1559. See Columbia, supra note 1, at 564.\n129. Jean Bodin, Six Bookes of a Commonweale, at bk. I, ch. 8 (Harv. Univ. Press ed. 1962, a facsimile of the English translation of 1606) (originally published in French in 1576). Bodin wrote: “Sovereignty is the most high, absolute, and perpetual power over the citizens and subjects in a Commonweale.” Id.; see Skinner II, supra note 35, at 284–88. According to F.H. Hinsley, sovereignty entails “the idea that there is a final and absolute political authority in the community,” F.H. Hinsley, Sovereignty 17 (2d ed. 1986), while to Charles Tilly, a theory of sovereignty appears to be “a set of coherent justifications which could be widely used in the consolidation of power.” Charles Tilly, Reflections on the History of European State-Making, in The Formation of National States in Western Europe 21 (Charles Tilly ed., 1975). Hinsley argues that the concept of sovereignty was first formulated in ancient Rome and then again in sixteenth-century Europe, probably first by Bodin. See Hinsley, supra, at 70, 126, 140–41. Michael Wilks, on the other hand, argues that a theory of the absolute sovereignty of monarchs existed during the Middle Ages, though it was articulated most often by the papacy. See Michael Wilks, The Problem of Sovereignty in the Later Middle Ages viii (1963).\n130. Israel, supra note 4, at 15; see Ben-Sasson, supra note 53, at 291–92.\n131.
