In the intervening years, its wallop has grown increasingly surreal and temptingly metaphoric. It blurs around the edges like movie or dream. Events are muddied by Peter’s angry and verbally abusive behavior toward other workshop students and me, by my students’ own privately conveyed misgivings about Peter’s writing and attitude, and by Peter’s penchant for bizarre subject matter. He had “the whole package,” as coaches say of their most gifted star players, but his came in all the wrong ways. Or was it all the right ways to make my students worry about and perhaps fear him? In short, the scene gets fuzzy for me as it does for the lone witness to a traffic accident. I wonder if the light had really gone from caution to red.\nWhen I talk of Peter, my wife tells me he always gave her “the creeps.” All of us think we know what that means, but what, really, does it purport? What good is saying something like that when trying to explain one’s concerns to the school shrink? I tell Peter’s story not because I handled it well. I didn’t. I should’ve been more aggressive, talking to him early on and perhaps urging him to seek help. I tell it because his story embodies for me many perils of violence that instructors face in the creative writing classroom. There, chin deep in the emotional lives of our students, we can’t always hide behind discussions of form or mere technique. (“That’s a wonderful line break, Peter, there where you say—’I sliced the loaf of / her throat.”) Inevitably, we’re forced to roam terrain that professors of math and physics and engineering—like proverbial angels—never have to tread. For good or ill, we must be prepared to face hard questions about students’ emotional health. While I talked to Peter that afternoon, I wondered who I’d be most likely to ink on, to violate the student’s trust—for his good or that of others and myself? Who would I most readily turn in—the student who might hurt others, the student who might hurt me, or the one who might hurt himself? And, more confounding, which of these is easiest to recognize and which simplest to persuade others that a problem exists? These questions grow thornier when one remembers that mental health is a thing not easily seen—the human quark, the sappy poem bottled within a wall.\nThis much I do know. Reader, that hammer changed everything for you, didn’t it? You were certain then that Peter needed help and that you had to intervene. That hammer—there in wood and steel, or there only in meta",
