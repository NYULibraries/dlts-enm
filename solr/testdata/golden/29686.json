Thomas C. Heller et al., 278–312 (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1986), Irwin’s The Mystery to a Solution: Poe, Borges, and the Analytic Detective Story (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996) argues that Poe makes the self “an identity in difference . . . an always-about-to-be-accomplished evenness constituted by its being originally and essentially at odds with itself” (413). Unlike Cavell and Irwin, I contend that Poe makes this “identity in difference” not only a linguistic or psychological principle but also, and primarily, a cosmogony.\n          \n          \n            47\tTypical for Poe, even the universe can’t stay buried; Eureka suggests that the supposedly conclusive collapse of the cosmos back into oneness represents merely an episode in the eternal oscillation between God’s diffusion and concentration: “the processes . . . will be renewed forever, and forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and then subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine” (Eureka, 1356). Here the systole–diastole of the telltale universe guarantees reincarnation through the perpetual pulse of “Life—Life—Life within life.” This does not mean, however, that individual identities survive. If anything, perpetual cosmic motion destabilizes individuality all the more because it disrupts the finality of the progression from self to God: with another “swelling into existence,” “a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may ensue” (Eureka, 1356).\n          \n          \n            48\tW.
