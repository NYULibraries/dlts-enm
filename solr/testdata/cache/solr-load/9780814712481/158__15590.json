            "pageText": "regulation of their bodies, though they lived in a society that guaranteed them equal rights. Ironically, as much as the collapse of the GDR brought women democracy, it also brought them the confrontation with a capitalist system and forms of gender discrimination that left them feeling victimized. Were they better off in the former GDR, where the material conditions seemed to favor their freedom of choice? Texts by Wolf and Maron imply that agency is only gained in remembrance, a gathering together of past moments and attempts at resistance for the present. It is a remembrance that depends on presence of mind and insight. Yet the affective components of remembrance come about though the body. Wolf’s remembering of Christa T. evokes a dilemma of moving beyond mourning to an active contemplation of the meaning of memory, and Maron imagines the possibility of leaving one’s body, in order to obtain a differentiated vantage point from which to observe and name the cultural networks that prevent a body’s freedom of expression.\nNOTES\nI thank Ellen Berry, Ute Brandes, and an anonymous reader for their insightful and candid feedback on earlier versions of this essay.\n1. In particular, former GDR women lost the right to unconditional, free, and legal abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, a right that had been guaranteed to them since 1972. For a detailed analysis of abortion politics in the GDR and following unification, see Katherine von Ankum, “Political Bodies: Women and Re/Production in the GDR,” Women in German Yearbook 9 (1993): 127–44 and Nanette Funk, “Abortion and German Unification,” in Gender Politics and Post-Communism: Reflections from Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, ed. Nanette Funk and Magda Mueller (New York: Roudedge, 1993), 194–200. References to works cited will be included parenthetically in the text after first full citation in the endnotes.\n2. Von Ankum demonstrates how the laws legislating women’s rights in the GDR clearly saw “women’s reproductive work” as “one of the primary indicators of their ideological commitment to socialism” (129). In 1971, the GDR government recognized that their attempt to regulate family growth had failed and they opted for supporting women’s productive capabilities in the workplace, while giving them more reproductive freedom. In 1972 abortion became legal (137). For further analysis of the situation of women prior and subsequent to unification, see Irene Dölling, “Alte und neue Dilemmata: Frauen in der ehemaligen DDR,” Women in German Yearbook 7 (1991): 121 — 36; Erica Fischer and Petra Lux, Ohne uns ist kein Staat zu machen.
