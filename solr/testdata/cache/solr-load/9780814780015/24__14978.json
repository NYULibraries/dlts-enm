You became famous and got to America for free, and all this because you were a German Jew without a birth certificate—you are to be envied!” Much of the article is a condemnation of Germany and its unfair laws that cause it to expel its own people. It ends, “I have cried enough in you, therefore I will not cry over you. … I want to forget you like you forgot me. You have your work … till you become a land where they don’t ask about religion, estate, place of birth and birth certificate. … Just as I am going to a land where they don’t ask anything more than ‘are you a human being?’”14\nFifteen years later, when the position of Jews in Germany had improved greatly, Philippson linked conditions in Germany and emigration, in a totally different way. In 1860 he condemned calls for mass emigration, saying that the improvement in the political situation of German Jews that had taken place would have been impossible if they had emigrated. “No, the destiny of our race seems to be a different one. It should collaborate with countries and nations, so that freedom of religion and humaneness may win.”15\nStill another use of the stereotyped vision of America as a land of freedom was made without either condemnation or support of emigration. In 1845 Ignaz Schulhoff, speaking of the lack of freedom of Bohemian Jews, asks, “Should all those who feel their chains, pack up and move to the land of the unlimited spirit?” He suggests a third alternative to emigration or staying behind, namely, “Whoever feels the need for freedom, let them free themselves and found their America in themselves.”16\nThe image of America as a land of freedom and an example of the shortcomings of Europe was often challenged by some of the factual reports coming out of the United States. The news that America, too, had its share of anti-Jewish feeling and narrow-minded religionists came as a shock to Europeans. Both the frequent reporting of such incidents in the German-Jewish press and the frequent prefacing of the reports with the comment that “even in America” such things could happen show how much emotional capital was expended on seeing America as the land of freedom for the Jews.17 Almost every anti-Jewish incident in mid-nineteenth-century ",
