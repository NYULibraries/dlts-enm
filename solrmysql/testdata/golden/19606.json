It predates sex industrialization and is extensive in primarily rural, poor and pre-industrial societies. Traffickers are traders in human beings who either buy women from husbands, buy children from parents, fraudulently promise them well-paying jobs or lucrative marriages at the other end, or they abduct them. Traffickers take their acquisitions to market via overland routes or, through the more sophisticated crime gangs such as Yakuza in Japan, they transfer women and girls by air to their destination, usually a brothel where acquired women and children are sold as merchandise. Trafficking, as distinguished from sex industrialization, is most aggravated to and from the poorest countries, states that are primarily rural or pre-industrial.\nAlthough trafficking in women is global, within as well as to and from each world region, it is best documented in the Asian region. The massive industrialization of sex in the Asian region, combined with the extensive work of human-rights and womenâ€™s-rights advocates in exposing trafficking and developing action programs ",
