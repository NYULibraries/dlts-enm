In a July 2013 action, youth voluntarily self-deported to Mexico in order to reenter the United States and claim asylum. Updating the youth’s status daily and sometimes hourly with the hashtag #bringthemhome, undocumented youth organizers have expanded and complemented the traditional public protest strategies of the immigrant rights movement with social media campaigns.\nFrom Georgia to California, youth of many different national and ethnic backgrounds now record testimonios before engaging in direct action to explain their reasons for risking deportation through acts of civil disobedience against deportation policies. In an example of this type of testimonio, Viridiana, then a 24-year-old member of the North Carolina Dream Team, begins her 2011 video, simply titled “Viridiana Martinez, North Carolina Dream Team,” “I am undocumented. If you’re watching this video I’ve been arrested.” She states how she is a proud North Carolinian and provides a bit of her background. Yet, soon after, her individual story takes a backseat as she explains things to those who may be unclear about why she took action:\nI am a human being whose dreams have been denied. For those wondering why I am putting my freedom on the line: Why would I risk deportation? Because I’ve had enough. My people have been criminalized for crossing borders seeking a better life.… My community is under attack by laws that strip people of their humanity. Remaining in the shadows is no longer acceptable. Protesting, lobbying, and rallying is not enough anymore.\nHer personal testimony is also a call to action. By reframing why action is not only important, but necessary, she asks her audience to also take action: “If you’re watching this and have not come out, it’s time you come out and declare yourself undocumented and unafraid.”\nIn a video from 2013 called “Bring Them Home: Lizbeth Mateo Checking In from Oaxaca, Mexico,” Lizbeth, who chose to “self-deport” knowing that “the U.S. government might not allow [her] to come back,” speaks from Oaxaca, urging viewers to take note of the dire consequences of U.S. immigration policies; in Lizbeth’s case, she was unable to see her family for 15 years as an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. ",
