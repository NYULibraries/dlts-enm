While each stage of Horney’s thought is important, I believe that her mature theory represents her most significant contribution. It provides explanations of human behavior in terms of currently existing constellations of defenses and inner conflicts that we can find nowhere else. It is this aspect of her thought that I have found to be of most value for the study of literature and that I shall describe here.\nAccording to Horney, we are not simply tension-reducing or conditioned creatures but have present in us an “evolutionary constructive” force that urges us “to realize” our “given potentialities” (1950, 15). We each have a biologically based inner nature, a “real self,” that it is our object in life to fulfill. Horney would have agreed with Abraham Maslow’s account of the basic psychological needs that must be met if we are to actualize our potentialities. These include physiological survival needs, needs for a safe and stable environment, needs for love and belonging, needs for esteem, and the need for a calling or vocation in which we can use our native capacities in an intrinsically satisfying way (Maslow 1970).\nHorney sees healthy human development as a process of self-realization and unhealthy development as a process of self-alienation. If our basic needs are relatively well met, we shall develop “the clarity and depth of [our] own feelings, thoughts, wishes, interests…; the special capacities or gifts [we] may have; the faculty to express [ourselves], and to relate [ourselves] to others with [our] spontaneous feelings. All this will in time enable [us] to find [our] set of values and [our] aims in life” (1950, 17). If our psychological needs are seriously frustrated, we shall develop in a quite different way. Self-alienation begins as a defense against “basic anxiety,” which is “a profound insecurity and vague apprehensiveness” (18) generated by feelings of isolation, helplessness, hostility, and fear. As a result of this anxiety, we “cannot simply like or dislike, trust or distrust, express [our] wishes or protest against those of another, but [we have] automatically to devise ways to cope with people and to manipulate them with minimum damage to [ourselves]” (Horney 1945, 219). We cope with others by developing the interpersonal strategies of defense that I shall examine next, and we seek to compensate for our feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy by an intrapsychic process of self-glorification. These strategies constitute our effort to fulfill our ",
