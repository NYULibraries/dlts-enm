These rules and customs are what Fiss called the “disciplinary rules” found in the “interpretive community.”63\nFiss’s notion of an objective interpretive process for normative decision making is representative of attempts by legal scholars to define a normative process for legal interpretation subject to judicial constraint. Thus, Fiss’s “disciplinary rules” of the “interpretive community,” are what Bickel and Bork call “original intent,”64 and what Ronald Dworkin more recently called the judge’s “interpretive attitude.”65 These “disciplinary rules,” “interpretive attitudes,” or “original intent” establish the basis for believing in the possibility of an objective interpretation for “filtering” and discovering community values.\nThus, a growing number of modern legal scholars subscribe to Fiss’s claim that “[a]djudication is interpretation: Adjudication is the process by which a judge comes to understand and express the meaning of an authoritative legal text and the values embodied in that text.”66 Dworkin advanced a similar claim, arguing that “we can improve our understanding of law by comparing legal interpretation with interpretation in … literature.”67 Modern liberal scholars share the belief that objective methods of interpretation can be discovered to give effect to the fundamental values that epitomize the Warren Court era.68 In this important sense, fundamental rights theory resembles the older jurisprudential theories associated with ideas of natural or divine law dominant during the premodern era. Fundamental rights theorists seek to describe “an objective moral reality” constructed from a set of authoritative legal principles and case precedents.69\nProcess-oriented normative theorists such as John Hart Ely argue that both interpretivism and noninterpretivism fail to ground constitutional adjudication in an objective source.70 Ely sought to ground law in a moral foundation based on a presumed consensus about fundamental process values. He believes that a proper interpretive concept can be applied to the democratic process.71 Ely insists that the proper role of the Supreme Court is to ensure that process of democracy is democratic and fully participatory. His argument rests on the belief that there is “one conception of democracy [which] is the right conception—right as a matter of ‘objective’ political morality—and that the job of the Court is to identify and protect this right conception.”72 Moral theory is relevant, not as an end in itself, but because it helps make sense of ",
