Then Gilman went on, incomprehensibly, to explain how this would save money because postdocs, unlike teaching assistants, would not receive tuition wavers. But of course tuition wavers in the humanities generally involve no transfer of funds; they are waivers, just like the term implies. So there is no money to be saved; in fact, if postdocs receive higher salaries than graduate assistants—as they surely should—then they will be more expensive.\nGilman knows, however, that postdocs are not likely to receive a good deal, so he once again deploys the logic of infantalization to justify a new system of inequities. He proposes that all postdocs be assigned a faculty mentor. Of course not all faculty members would be eager to make a major emotional and professional investment in a short-term employee, but the failed human logic is not the worst part of Gilman’s proposal. What is worst is the real reason for infantalizing new Ph.Ds by suggesting they need mentors—to justify their low salaries. As I think of two of my former students who were on the job market in 1995, both in their fifth attempt to find a job—one with a book in press at Cambridge, another with a book in press at Illinois, both with teaching experience at several schools—it does not take much reflection to realize they need a job, not a mentor. What advice they do need they get from their peers and the people who have worked with them for a decade. They do not need Gilman’s marvelous condescension.\nWhat is significantly new in Gilman’s essay is his proposal for an organized national program of postdoctoral teaching fellowships. I believe Gilman’s national clearinghouse for “mentored” postdoctoral fellows is one of the most ill-considered and dangerous plans ever to receive the MLA’s imprimatur. One might have titled his address “How to End Tenure,” because that is the result it would help to produce. There are any number of administrators who would love to turn a significant amount of their lower-level undergraduate courses over to postdocs costing 50 to 60 percent as much as faculty members. Gilman even throws in the added plus of “limited benefits.” We all know what that means: no health care for the kids, no vestment in a retirement program.\nOf course any national program would instantly run into the wide discrepancies in the salaries, teaching loads, and benefits offered postdocs. Some English departments presently assign two courses per semester, while others demand three or four. Some offer full family health care, others only coverage for the faculty member. Some prohibit participation in retirement programs; a few offer TIAA/CREF. And access to travel money and other support varies widely, as does the per course salary rate. Putting all these differences on the table where they can be compared might shame some programs into treating their postdocs and adjuncts better, but we need to remember that much of corporate higher ",
