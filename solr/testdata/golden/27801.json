The idea of a moderate jealousy or an acceptance of intense jealousy devoted to basic fidelity rather than exclusiveness had dropped from view. One famous advice writer, Paul Popenoe, moved against the tide in arguing that jealousy was a vital support for monogamy (so long as it was expressed “on an adult level”—Popenoe admitted that jealousy could easily transgress proper bounds, becoming “a childish and destructive habit”). With this interesting exception, the marriage literature united in condemnation: “Jealousy is a terrible emotion, one of the extreme forms of psychological cruelty.” While jealousy indicated problems in a relationship, it pointed even more clearly to deficiencies—insecurities or even a hidden desire for infidelity—on the part of the jealous individual. Advice writers mastered the put-down on immaturity, stating that even infidelity should be manageable: “We are upset to varying degrees, but usually not so deeply as we think.”40 Intensity, once more, need not apply.\nThe attacks on jealousy fed into the culture of the 1960s as both feminists and advocates of open marriages and other experiments continued the salvos against emotional possessiveness. Some partisans of these movements shifted ground slightly by arguing that jealousy was itself unnatural, a learned emotion, and that a proper person should be jealousy-free. Others, however, acknowledged the problems of deficient childrearing and the need for rigorous adult self-control as sexual experimentation became increasingly common and overt. One open-marriage manual instructed a spouse on what to say when a partner called to report that he was spending the night away: “Fine, I’m glad things are going so well. Enjoy yourself and I look forward to hearing about it tomorrow.” In the 1970s a jealousy workshop movement briefly flourished in some American cities, run by practitioners like Larry Constantine and Robert and Margaret Blood; the idea was to train people to get used to their partners’ sexual involvements with others. Designed for those “who are strongly motivated to outgrow jealousy,” the workshops defined success as acceptance of full marital freedom. Jealousy would not be concealed or denied; it simply would not exist as partners would learn to praise the advantages of their mutual excursions. In the words of one exemplar: “I really appreciate the fact that after you’ve been with Ann you seem more accepting of me and the children.”41\nThe language of the movement against adult jealousy was widely accepted within the middle class.
