            "pageText": "A police car was driving by and the officer saw the clerk yelling that the store had been robbed. He was pointing at Hooty’s car and shouting “get them!” One thing Hooty and his sister knew was that the police would never believe their side of the story. Hooty rapidly drove the car away, trying to get to the safety of their grandmother’s cabin in the hills outside of town. Two police cars began a chase that would end in blood.\nDuring the five-mile chase, Darrell leaned out the car window and fired one shot in a failed attempt to hit the police car’s tire. After arriving at Rocky Gulch, Hooty and Norma Jean started running up a hill into the woods. Darrell grabbed the rifle and followed them. The police arrived and began shooting. Seventeen-year-old Jasper and eighteen-year-old Carol had not run into the hills; they surrendered and were handcuffed to some bushes. The police called for help, and soon there were twelve to fourteen cars with law enforcement personnel: California Highway Patrol, deputy sheriffs, and off-duty police. One of those off-duty policemen was Jesse “Bo” Hittson. He had won a stock car race earlier that evening and had gone to a barbecue where he had a few drinks. Hearing the police radio call, he rushed to the scene and jumped out of his vehicle, forgetting his bulletproof vest on the seat. He had his .357 magnum loaded with hollow-tipped bullets, which explode inside the body.\nHooty, Darrell, and Norma Jean were pinned down by the gunfire.

Bullets from M-i6s, AR-15S, shotguns, and revolvers were smashing into the trees. They had one small-caliber rifle. Darrell and Hooty passed the hunting rifle between them and fired five to ten shots. A few bullets hit the police cars; one policeman got shot in the hand. The police had no command center; there was no supervision. They just kept firing into the woods. Between 75 and 150 shots were fired at the three Indians. Darrell stood up, trying to surrender, and was shot in the groin. Norma Jean tried to run and was shot in the back.\nDarrell yelled out, “I’m wounded and Norma Jean is dying!” The police yelled back, “We’ll give you a half-hour to surrender!” There was no more shooting. Hooty, now with the rifle, started making his way back to his grandmother’s cabin to see if she and his elderly aunt were still alive. At the same time, Hittson and another officer began moving toward ",
