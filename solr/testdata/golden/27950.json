            "pageText": "After a prior career in middle management, some executives doubtless maintained a controlled, superficially friendly style, but this was far from the norm.4\nFurthermore, precisely because intensity was normally shunned, the impact of a temperamentally manipulative executive could be confusing. Outbursts that would usually bring discredit to their presenters were less clear cut when combined with power. Small wonder that many middle managers commented on how “frazzled” they were; in addition to meeting their own requirements of emotional control, they also had to mediate between demanding working-class subordinates and angry bosses. By the same token, chief executives could escape from a work life of emotional caution by capping successful promotion with a relaxation of the twentieth-century emotional rules.5\nBy 1990 a new phrase denoted both the temptation of those atop the hierarchy to indulge in more spontaneous emotion and the tension that this habit could evoke. American leaders began to speak, or be spoken of, in terms of “going ballistic.” Thus in 1992 President Bush was reported as “going ballistic” over information leaks in his administration. Or as the same president had disclosed in 1988, with characteristic verbal felicity, he might at times go “a little ballistic—which is only part true—semi-ballistic.” This exaggerated missile terminology suggests both an attempt to recognize the unusual, extreme quality of anger even at this level and a desire to make sure the emotion drew attention by subordinates. Emotional life, newly constrained at most middle-class levels, was definitely not yet egalitarian.6\nThe Therapeutic Approach\nThe constraints of the new emotional culture were clearly reflected in the growing use of formal therapy, wherein individuals sought to release their grief, anger, or fear in the privacy of a professional office. Talking out intense emotions became a central therapeutic mechanism that fit the wider notions of verbal venting while also serving as an acceptable, because confidential, outlet.7\nAlong with individual sessions, group therapy movements built on the dominant culture and its attendant constraints. In 1959, to take one widely publicized example, Synanon was established in California to provide self-help for heroin addicts. The organization was founded on ",
