Jeffrey Cohen and Karl Steel offered vital support and sage advice at key points, and Myra Seaman was a source of regular encouragement and numerous suggestions. Others who helped nurture the project directly or indirectly—though they may not recognize or endorse the final results— include Valerie Allen, Jane Bennett, Liza Blake, Brantley Bryant, Phil Cook, Lisa Cooper, Holly Crocker, Becky Davis, Lowell Duckert, Lara Farina, Melissa Furrow, Anne Harris, Jonathan Hsy, Dan Kline, Julia Lupton, Nicola Masciandaro, Julie Orlemanski, Dan Remein, Kellie Robertson, Eve Salisbury, Vance Smith, Ben Tilghman, Peter Travis, and David Wallace. Many thanks to Will Robbins, Suzanne Akbari, Alex Gillespie, and others for welcoming me to speak at the 2011 Canada Chaucer Seminar at the University of Toronto; I am equally grateful to Vin Nardizzi, Patricia Badir, and Robert Rouse for inviting me to deliver the inaugural talk in the 2013–14 Oecologies Speaker Series at the University of British Columbia. Other important test sites included meetings of the New Chaucer Society, the BABEL Working Group, and the International Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo.\n        Thanks to the several institutions on whose resources I have drawn: the Bodleian Libraries, the Museum of London, the British Library, the Wellcome Institute Library, the British Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution. Funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada was essential to the realization of this book.\n        Thanks to the University of Minnesota Press, in particular to Doug Armato, Danielle Kasprzak, and the rest of the editorial team, for backing the project.\n        I remain indebted to Maureen for all that matters. The following chapters would have been unthinkable without the love and runaway enthusiasms of my children, Myles and Leo, to whom I dedicate the book.\n      \n      \n\n",
