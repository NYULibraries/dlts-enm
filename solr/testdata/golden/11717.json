            "pageText": "a certain spirituality manifests itself within a particular nation, this is not sufficient until it becomes clearly conscious of it, realizing that what is emerging from among them is a spiritual matter which upholds and sustains the nation.” As for the “divine presence was with them,” clearly, for Krochmal, this refers to the representational way in which the rabbinic sages gave voice to their comprehension of the fact that God is a universal and absolute spirit, bound by neither place nor historical circumstance; further, this is the way the rabbis give voice to the conviction that the people of Israel remained committed to their God even in exile.\n28. It cannot be claimed that Krochmal does not deal with the history of other peoples because it is beside his point. The proper understanding of the history of other peoples is fundamental to his purpose. For, only if the other nations go through the process he describes and then disappear is there anything unique about the Jews. He does not need to deal with the course of general history because it is, for him, a settled matter. The historiography of his time had taken care of that. We must take him very seriously when he states that he is trying to prove the repetition of the pattern among the Jews, rather than attempting to prove the veracity of the pattern itself.\n29. See, for example, Rawidowicz, Introduction, pp. 117-21; Lionel Kochan, The Jew and His History (New York: Schocken, 1977), p. 74; Jacob Taubes, “Nachman Krochmal and Modern Historicism,” Judaism, vol. 13 (1963), throughout. The issue cannot be decided because Krochmal simply does not sufficiently elaborate on his historical model. The fact is that Krochmal’s approach resembles that of each of these thinkers in certain particulars, indicating that Krochmal was quite satisfied to incorporate the common denominator among these various positions. Such a laconic and eclectic presentation would have no place in a work designed to present an original theory of history, for it could not hope to convince; it does quite well, however, in a work designed to respond to the common thread in modern historiography. Rawidowicz has argued for a connection of Krochmal’s theories with those of Vico’s, and in one respect—maintaining the eternality of Israel and its exemption from “normal” patterns—they are extremely close. But, as opposed to the organismic pattern of national histories, Krochmal can scarcely treat this eternality as established, and in any event, his attachment to this most traditional of notions is ",
