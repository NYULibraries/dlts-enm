            "pageText": "control that accompanied Japanese military mobilization, such discourse would begin to lose its nationalist coloring. Nevertheless, the core idea that film’s inherently popular quality and character gave it social and even spiritual importance continued to dominate. In a 1937 article titled “Cinema and the People,” Yi Un-gok argued:\n\nWe should not fail to recognize the social power that film possesses. Thus it is necessary to examine, from the position of the people, the impact a film’s contents and function can have on culture and everyday practices. It would be extremely difficult to articulate this position (of the people) with perfect clarity, but broadly speaking … it could be the position that is presupposed both by the people’s improvement toward humanism and by the formation of the morals that spring from the people’s everyday lives.21\n\nLike Pak and many others, Yi saw film as a critically important political tool, one that could be badly abused if not tamed and attuned to the people’s interests. This figuration of film art as an instrument through which to lead and instruct the masses on behalf of the greater (imperial/national) good is, as it was for literature of the period, a function of the class position of the artists themselves, the cultural and economic chasm that separated urban from rural populations, and the overwhelming pressures of colonial modernization. The cinema was seen as an important means through which to prepare ethnic Koreans, if not for national sovereignty, then for full civilizational realization.\nPublic discussion shifted drastically in the late 1930s and 1940s as Japanese war mobilization and then extreme ideological division drove the film industry to nearly total state control. Enlightenment discourse, which, despite its mass political dimension and strong associations with public policy, had remained relatively independent of official control, lost that autonomy and became absorbed in the close administration of all cultural forms in this period. The enlightenment film, as a result, became nearly synonymous with government propaganda. But this break, and the similarly dramatic transformation that followed liberation in 1945, prompts us to think carefully about the scope and specificity of enlightenment discourse in film. While the didactic voice and a populist spirit would remain features of what was termed the “new order” (sin ch’eje) of films, and while certainly the kwihyang narrative would continue to serve as the basis of a number of important works, the focus of filmmaking under the centralized Chosŏn Film Production Company (Chosŏn yŏnghwa chejak chusik hoesa) would change. Films like Volunteer Soldier (Chiwŏn pyŏng, 1941) and The ",
