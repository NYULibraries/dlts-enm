A practical epistemology may or may not meet medical or scientific criteria of truth; its standard of validity is more immediately sensible and can be summed up in the question Does it work? or Is it useful? A practical epistemology reclaims ordinary experience as a pathway to knowledge. Based on immediate, tangible, and sensory evidence of cause and effect between bodies and environments, EI reconciles the self and the body. It restores a sense of order between the cognitive, emotional, and somatic parts of a person. In short, while it is not a cure, the story of EI may help a person to heal. “I sometimes wonder if MCS is real,” a mother and housewife writes, “I mean, a lot of people think it isn’t.

I mean psychologically alive.”\nStaying “physically” and “psychologically alive” through telling stories about environments and bodies framed in the borrowed language of biomedicine is a pragmatic response to the question, Yes, but are these stories true? If a new body is emerging in society, however, it will need to satisfy more than the chemically reactive themselves.
