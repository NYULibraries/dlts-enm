In attempting to defend the vitality of Jewish life beyond the First Commonwealth period, Krochmal develops a doctrine of limited progress within the Jewish tradition that effectively dates the true origins of that tradition to the Second Commonwealth period;42 in effect, Krochmal argues that what we know as Judaism originated after the Babylonian exile. This position was becoming a commonplace among historians, both Jewish and gentile. It was, of course, anathema to the Orthodox. Krochmal, despite his allegiance to Jewish tradition, obviously feels that modern historians had credibly made their case. It would be sheer obstinacy to demur.\nThis leads, then, to subtle reworkings of traditional material. To better illustrate this, recall the passage quoted above to the effect that not even those who witnessed the theophany at Sinai were able to achieve an understanding of God comparable to that achieved by the Jews of the second cycle; to this compare the following passage from the Mekilta:\n“This is my God and I will glorify him” (Ex. 15:2) R. Eliezer says: Whence can you say that a maidservant saw at the sea what Isaiah and Ezekiel and all the other prophets never saw? It says about them, “And by the ministry of the prophets I have used similitudes” (Hos. 12:11). And it is also written: “The heavens were opened and I saw visions of God” (Ezek. 1:1) …. But as soon as they (the maidservants at the sea) saw Him (without similitudes) they recognized him, and they all opened their mouths and said: “This is my God and I will glorify him.” (Laut. pp. 24-25; slightly modified)\nNow, to be sure, the Mekilta passage is scarcely normative, and may merely represent a rabbi drawing connections between ",
