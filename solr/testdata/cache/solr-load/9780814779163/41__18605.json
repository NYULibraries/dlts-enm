(Sachau 1964, 17–18)\n\nAl-Biruni then mentions other obstacles to understanding. It is very difficult, he says, to transcribe Indian into Arabic words; and Indian scribes are careless; and Indian books are composed in verse, the words of which are often vague or verbose for the sake of the meter. The Indian religion is totally different, he observes, and extremely fanatical. All of Indian “fanaticism is directed against those who do not belong to them—against all foreigners. They call them mleccha, i.e. impure, and forbid having any connection with them, be it by intermarriage or any other kind of relationship” (Sachau 1964, 19). They so differ from Moslems in all manners and customs, he says, that they declare Moslems to be devilish and frighten their children with them. They also suffer from the incurable folly of believing\nthat there is no country like theirs, no nation like theirs, no religion like theirs, no science like theirs. They are haughty, foolishly vain, self-conceited, and stolid. They are by nature niggardly in communicating that which they know, and they take the greatest possible care to withhold it from men of another caste among their own people, still much more, of course, from any foreigner. Their haughtiness is such that, if you tell them of any science or scholar in Khurasan and Persis, they will think you both an ignoramus and a liar. If they travelled and mixed with other nations, they would soon change their mind, for their ancestors were not as narrow-minded as the present generation is. (Sachau 1964, 22–23)\nThe second witness of India on whom I would like to draw is the Abbé A. J. Dubois, a Christian missionary who lived for some thirty-one years in South India and left a book recording life in India from 1792 to 1823. Most of what he has recorded, he says, is the result of his own life with\npersons of every caste and condition of life. … I had no sooner arrived amongst the natives of India than I recognized the absolute necessity of ",
