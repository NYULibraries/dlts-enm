            "pageText": "What followed is an early version of a colloquy that would be replayed countless times over the next two decades—and many times more, right up to the present day. It is at once enlightening and bewildering, as befits, perhaps, its subject. At issue was the meaning, theoretically and practically, of that elusive term “equality.”\n\nDavis: The Senator objects to the argument which treats of the proposition of himself and his friends, as the assertion of equality between the negro and white races. Do I understand him as denying the equality, or does he admit the equality?\nWilson: The natural equality of all men I believe in, as far as the rights are concerned. So far as mental or physical equality is concerned, I believe the African race inferior to the white race.\nDavis: “Natural equality” would imply that God had created them equal, and had left them equal, down to the present time. Is that what the Senator means?\nWilson: I believe in the equality of rights of all mankind. I do not believe in the equality of the African race with the white race, mentally or physically, and I do not think morally.\nDavis: When the Senator says “equality of rights of all men,” does he mean political and social rights—political and social equality?\nWilson: I believe that every human being has the right to his life and to his liberty, and to act in this world so as to secure his own happiness. I believe, in a word, in the Declaration of Independence; but I do not, as I have said, believe in the mental or moral or physical equality of some of the races, as against this white race of ours.\nDavis: Then the Senator believes and he does not believe, and he changes his position so rapidly in giving his answers that it is impossible to tell what he does believe.\nHarlan: Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question?\nDavis: Oh, yes.\nHarlan: Do you believe in the political and social equality of all individuals of the white race?\nDavis: I will answer you, yes; the exact political equality of all white men who are citizens of the United States. That equality may be lost by the commission of crime; but white men, the descendants of the Adamic race, under our institutions, are born equal; and that is the effect of the Declaration of Independence.\nHarlan: If the Senator will allow me, being “born equal” is a phrase that involves the proposition that the Senator from Massachusetts has stated. I inquired as to their social and their political equality.\n",
