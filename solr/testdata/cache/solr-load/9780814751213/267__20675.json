On this issue, see the thoughtful concurrence and dissent by Judge Richard Posner in Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 151 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 506 (1996).\n29. See Lee v.

See also Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441 (1st Cir. 1991) (prison officials’ reasonable but mistaken belief that emergency existed justified a visual body cavity search of a male inmate in the presence of female guards); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 334 (9th Cir. 1988) (“assigned positions of female guards that require only infrequent and casual observation, or observation at distance, and that are reasonably related to prison needs are not so degrading as to warrant court interference”); Griffin v. Michigan Dept. Corrections, 654 F. Supp. 690 (E.D. Mich. 1982); Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099 (D. Or. 1983). But see contra Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1994); Fortner v.
