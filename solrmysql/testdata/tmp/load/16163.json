Well, during one portion of the conversation Sonny mentioned that he was pleased with the way I was handling things in Florida, that I was earning money and wasn’t always running to him for money like other members of his crew. And he said that shortly that the Commission was going to open up the books for membership in the family and that he was—he could nominate five individuals and the number one guy was going to be John Sarisante and the other four slots he was obligated to either sons or relatives of members, other members in the family.\nQ. Did he tell you anything else with respect to you and your chances for membership?\nA. He said that the books would open up again, were going to open up again next year and that he was going to propose me for membership in the family.\nQ. When he used the phrase “the Commission is going to open up the books,” what did he mean?\nA. That the Commission had given permission for families to induct members.\nQ. Was he referring to families in the New York area?\nA. That’s what I understood him to mean, yes.\nQ. What if anything else did Sonny Black Napolitano say to you about your possible membership in the Family?\nA. He said that when the books opened up next year he was going to propose me for membership.\nQ. Did he ask you any information about yourself in connection with that?\nA. Yes, he asked me if I had had any drug arrest, and I told him no, I didn’t.\nQ. What if anything did he say in response when you told him that you had no drug arrests?\nA. Well, he said that was good and the reason being that the cops, you know—would be less heat I would take, less heat from the cops, they wouldn’t be looking at me as strong if I didn’t have any drug arrests.\nQ. You remained in the New York City area through December, is that correct?\nA. Through the new year, that’s correct.\nQ. And did you continue to meet with Mr. Ruggiero and Mr. Napolitano during the time that you were there?\nA. Yes, we would meet every day at the Motion Lounge.\nQ. In particular, let me direct your attention to December 24 of that year, 1980, did you have occasion to have any conversations on that day?\nA. Yes.\nQ. With whom did you speak?\nA. Well, on the 24th we were at the Motion Lounge and it was myself, Napolitano, Ruggiero, Santura, Sarisante and other individuals who were—who hung out and were members of Sonny’s crew.\n",
