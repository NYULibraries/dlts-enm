Having escaped San Francisco with the heroin, Ray Hicks, a Vietnam veteran, and Marge Converse, wife of Hicks’s partner in the importation of the drug, stop briefly in an isolated area of the Hollywood hills. During a brief respite from violence, Marge sees people hiding among the trees and asks Hicks what they are seeking. Hicks answers:\nBodies. … Sometimes they find a car off the road with nobody in it. They have to look for the driver. They’ll see a drunk run his car into the canyon and they’ll creep out at night to take the guy’s wallet. They go for the credit cards. … The big ones eat the little ones, up here.172\nAny notion that community is possible is ridiculed in this modern wasteland. Escaping the perversions of the city, Hicks joins Dieter, once the guru of a communal retreat in New Mexico that became corrupted by drugs. Ironically, Dieter seeks to recruit Hicks, still in possession of the heroin, to help him revitalize the retreat. Hicks, however, is unable and unwilling to attempt to resuscitate an ideal that in post–Vietnam America is anachronistic and unworkable. The failure to find or maintain a separate peace is underlined when the commune is shattered by a firefight between Hicks and those seeking to steal the heroin. In this scene the war comes home with all its traumatic force as Hicks is wounded attempting to escape with the heroin.\nHallucinating from the pain of his wounds, Hicks imagines himself accepting and thereby dispelling the pain that existed in Vietnam: “All that cringing, all those crying women, whining kids—I don’t want to see that, I don’t like it. Give it here. … Napalm burns, no problem—just put it here.”173 Hicks’s long, painful, and finally fatal retreat from his pursuers focuses his perceptions concerning social conditions within America in the wake of the war in Vietnam:\n[k]now what’s out there? Every goddamn race of shit jerking each other off. Mom and Dad and Buddy and Sis, two hundred million rat-hearted cock-suckers in enormous cars. Rabbits and fish. They’re mean and stupid and greedy, they’ll fuck you for laughs, they want you dead. If you’re no better than them you might as well take gas. If you can’t get your own on them then don’t stand there and let them spit on you, don’t give them the satisfaction.174\nWithin this dystopic view of a fraying social fabric is the suggestion that “we” are all victims of the war in Vietnam.
