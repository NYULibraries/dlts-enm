On the first try, he burnt the end of the needle with the blue tip of a match flame so it blended in better with the color of the coin. Mrs. Bill could hear him whooping away with joy in his invention room all week, and she spent an extra five minutes a day under his window, praying that his new invention would be something useful and completely unlike a machine. Jerry was so involved in his current project that he hardly had time to observe her.\nHe waited for Gully on the front porch on Saturday morning so he would get to him before Mrs. Bill. It excited him that he could employ something as small and innocent-looking as a trick coin, hidden in an ordinary shirt pocket, in the general scheme against his mother.\nAs he rode up in front of the house, Gulliver waved to Jerry with one arm and ran his banana bike into a juniper bush on the front lawn. He wrestled the bike out of the bush, then puffed his way up to the porch.\n“Will you show me the trick now, Jerry?” he piped.\nIt was just as he had guessed. Gully’s little mind had been absorbed by the trick all week too. He noted also that Gully had called him Jerry. They understood each other now. They were brothers now. They were co-conspirators. They were friends.\n“I’ll show you,” he said, “but only if you promise to do something for me.”\nGully gulped.\n“After you finish your collecting today, come back here and take a ride into town with me to a curio shop.”\nHe knew that Mrs. Bill took a walking tour every Saturday afternoon and it would be a safe time to plot alone with Gully. Mrs. Bill would never expect anything underhanded could happen during her walking tour.\n",
