            "pageText": "From the standpoint of real wages, however, there is a different pattern. In ten of the first forty years in the century, they fell. Yet, in six of the past twenty years (1970-89), real wages also have declined, a slightly higher proportion of years. Early in the century, falling real wages were brought about in some years by downward wage adjustments, in other years by upward price adjustments, and in some years by both factors; late in the century, however, decreases in real wages have come about exclusively through upward adjustments in prices.\nPut differently, early in the century, private decision-making in the private sector in response to market conditions seemed to initiate downward real-wage adjustments in several years; in modern times, downward real-wage adjustments seem to have resulted from price increases that may be largely initiated by macroeconomic policy. Also, in the early part of the century, downward real-wage adjustments may have come quicker than in recent years. For example, real wages fell some 11 percent between 1979 and 1989—but in no single year did they fall as much as 2.7 percent. Real wages were quite flexible downward—but it took time for the full adjustment to occur. By contrast, on eight different occasions before America’s entry into World War II, real wages fell more than 3 percent in a single year.\nIt may be, however, that the observed decline in the variability of wages has been exaggerated by biases arising from splicing together sets of wage data for different periods computed using different methodologies. Steven Allen has replicated methods used to calculate wages in the prewar era for postwar data, concluding that money-wage volatility has not fallen—the observed decline is a statistically created illusion.12\nNonetheless, the prevailing wisdom still is that real-wage flexibility has diminished. The reasons for this will be explored in greater detail in coming chapters. We would observe here that two constraints on wage flexibility are found today that did not exist to a major extent in the first decades of this century. First, in the earlier years, relatively few employees worked under contracts. The growth in collective bargaining brought about more wage rigidity. Workers usually work under multiyear contracts; cost-of-living adjustment clauses in some contracts make it difficult to reduce real wages in the short run. Also, the growth in the relative importance of government employment has increased the “wage inflexibility” problem since government compensation has historically been notoriously slow to respond to changing market conditions.\nA second problem has been the growth in direct government intervention in labor markets. With the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the federal government imposed minimum-wage requirements that have materially altered the market for relatively unskilled labor. Other legislation ",
