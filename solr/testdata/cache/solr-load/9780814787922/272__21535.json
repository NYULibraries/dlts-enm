As table 14.1 indicates, the mean rate of unemployment for the three dates differs by only 0.08 percentage points between whites and nonwhites. In every case, the nonwhite-white unemployment ratio is between .92 and 1.17, suggesting that the similarities between the races in terms of unemployment were more striking than the differences.\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE DIFFERENTIAL SINCE 1940\nThe era of discernible race differentials in unemployment probably began in the 1930s, although it was not entirely obvious until a decade later (table 14.2).
