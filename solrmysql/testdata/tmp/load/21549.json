            "pageText": "of the approach in the text), the estimated rise in the migration-adjusted nonwhite-white unemployment rate differential is greater, rising from 1.22 in 1930 to 1.76 in 1980. Using this approach, only 35 percent of the unadjusted rise in the differential is explainable by geographical mobility. Adjusting labor-force distributions of both racial groups to that of the total population, however, yields a result close to that reported in the text.\n11. In doing so, we switch to using the census rather than the CPS estimates for the postwar period. The reader may wonder why we did not average the 1900 and 1930 census results with respect to geographical distribution; the published race-specific unemployment data were not available for the earlier date.\n12. John Cogan believes the decline in demand for agricultural labor played a major role in the decline in black teenage labor-force involvement in the postwar era. See his “The Decline in Black Teenage Employment: 1950–70,” American Economic Review 72 (1982): 621–38.\n13. The estimation of the impact of the changing compositional structure of the labor force on racial unemployment differentials involved calculating the proportions of individuals employed in each of several major occupational categories, along with unemployment rates for each category, for several census years. Occupational composition data came from the occupations volumes of several censuses, e.g. Fifteenth Census of the United States: 1930, Population, Volume IV, Occupations By States (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1933), or 1980 Census of Population, Volume 1, Chapter D, Detail Population Characteristics, Part 1 United States Summary (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1984).\n14. A fuller discussion can be found in our as yet unpublished 1991 paper “Racial Dimensions of the Davis-Bacon Act.”\n15. Gary Becker, The Economics of Discrimination, 2d ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971).\n16. Along these lines, Price Fishback demonstrates that coal companies competed vigorously for black labor in the early 1900s, despite the apparent existence of racial discrimination. See Price V. Fishback, “Can Competition among Employers Reduce Governmental Discrimination? Coal Companies and Segregated Schools in West Virginia in the Early 1900s,” Journal of Law and Economics 32 (1989): 311–28. For a more comprehensive demonstration that blacks benefited from competition among white employers, see Robert Higgs, Competition and Coercion: Blacks in the American Economy, 1865–1914 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977). For a more elaborate analysis of the theory of employment discrimination, see Richard A. Epstein, Forbidden Grounds: The Case Against Employment Discrimination Laws (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992), especially chaps. 2-4.\n17. A particularly useful symposium on the economic status of African-Americans is included in the fall 1990 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives. In particular see Gerald D. Jaynes, “The Labor Market Status of Black Americans, 1939–1985,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 4 (1990): 9–24, and Jonathan S. Leonard, “The Impact of Affirmative Action Regulation and Equal Employment Law on Black Employment,” ibid., pp. 47-64.\n",
