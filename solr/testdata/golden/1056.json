This strategic integration of racially hybrid “Japanese” models into a symbolically constructed global fashion scene ultimately reduces race, ethnicity, and culture to a series of playful identifications for Japanese consumers to enjoy (Darling-Wolf, 2006).\nWhile such racial representations disturbingly fail to acknowledge the global implications of the politics of race/culture by reducing them to things one wears or consumes they also help to complicate racial identification. In particular, by positioning racially hybrid models as culturally Japanese, Men’s non-no underscores the constructed nature of race in Japan. In a nation where discourses about racial purity have often historically intersected with constructions of national identity (Iwabuchi, 2006), this is a potentially destabilizing discourse.\nWhen Gender and Race Intersect\nInterestingly, and in sharp contrast to U.S. publications targeted at a male readership, Men’s non-no also displays a rather playful and irreverent attitude toward constructions of gender. In keeping with representations of masculinity found throughout the Japanese popular cultural environment (Darling-Wolf, 2004) Men’s non-no’s models and the celebrities it features—Gackt, Takuya Kimura, Yôsuke Kubozuka, Jun Matsumoto—are frequently highly androgynous. The magazine further minimizes gender distinctions through a process of “masculinization” of its female models included in fashion spreads, who often appear dressed in androgynous attire and posed in similar poses as their male counterparts (for specific examples, see Darling-Wolf, 2006—or browse the magazine online at http://www.mensnonno.jp). Again, such representations serve to complicate and deconstruct fixed and essentializing constructions of gender by pointing to its socially determined and artificial nature. Just as with race, ethnicity, and culture, however, the magazine’s equation of gender-bending with consumption mitigates the potentially empowering elements of its representations, as expensive fashion becomes the ultimate gender equalizer.\nFurthermore, Men’s non-no’s fluid constructions of race, ethnicity, and gender powerfully contrast with those found in non-no, its sister publication targeted at a female readership. Unlike Men’s non-no’s almost exclusively visual discourse (the men’s magazine offers very little textual contextualization to its fashion spreads) of multiple and ambiguous gendered, racial, and cultural identifications, non-no’s discourse is highly gendered. While men are occasionally mentioned or quoted in non-no’s editorial content, they are almost completely visually excluded from its pages—male models never seem to appear, for instance, in fashion spreads—resulting in a discourse that, despite\n",
