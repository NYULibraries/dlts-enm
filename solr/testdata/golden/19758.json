The core group of determined abolitionists persisted despite the unpopularity of their message.\nThis has been the pattern globally. By 1927 the international Slavery Convention entered into force declaring what had been unthinkable a century before: “the firm intention of putting an end to the traffic in African slaves” and hence “to bring about, progressively and as soon as possible, the complete abolition of slavery in all of its forms” (article 2b).\nTo imagine a world without prostitution is to conceive of eliminating the sexual exploitation of all women. Unless we can go that way, rape-crisis work and protection for abused women will lead only to what I call the “Evian solution,” that is, will reduce our work to a drop in a bucket, to something akin to sending a case of Evian water to a drought-stricken country.\nNew laws, national and international, cannot replace responsive action. But they are an important part of the strategy, because they establish the base and standards for the liberation of women. As legal change will always fall short of feminist demands, we must pursue it while also knowing that it will never be sufficient. Activism must be shaped from feminist consciousness of domination as it must reveal women s refusal to co-exist on this planet with sexual exploitation.\nProstitution makes all women vulnerable, exposed to danger, open to attack. To be vulnerable is, by definition, to be “able to be hurt or wounded or injured.” Such vulnerability is publicly institutionalized sexual exploitation. Sexual exploitation is privately institutionalized in marriage.\nThe point is that women’s vulnerability to sexual exploitation is an institutionalized social system. From distancing to disengagement, women lose the boundaries that identify them to themselves ",
