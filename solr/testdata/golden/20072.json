A modern recreation of the separate system exists at Pelican Bay State Prison in California, which is based on “extreme, around-the-clock isolation of prisoners from virtually all human contact.” Jennifer Warren, “A Modern-Day Dungeon,” Los Angeles Times, 7 September 1993, sec. A, p. 3.\nDuring a visit to this prison in 1993, 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace expressed his amazement in language that evokes Tocqueville and Beaumont’s description of Auburn a century and a half earlier:\n\nWALLACE: Do they mix with each, the—all the guys in this pod?\nLT. DEINES: No they do not. Any communication they have is through the door. If they come out of their pods, they will come in contact with no other inmate. They can talk, but they have no physical contact.\n",
